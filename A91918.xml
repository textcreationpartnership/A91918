            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N every age and nation, the ſins that provoke God to wrath are many, and the <hi>Seers</hi> or <hi>Remembrancers</hi> (ſo are Gods Miniſters call'd, and ſo they are) do <hi>ſigh</hi> and mourn for them, yea and forewarn and <hi>cry out</hi> against them, as in <hi>Ezek. 9.4.</hi> The ſins of this our age and nation, which have provoked the Lord our God to poure out the vialls of his wrath upon us, though not eaſily numbred or named, yet that one onely ſin of Pride is ſo high, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, and ſo generall, that even for this ſin alone all the judgements which we have already felt, or do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after feare, are moſt due and juſt.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be the Lord our God, who hath hitherto in mercy, as a father, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed us for our amendment; and not in fury, as a Judge, utterly conſumed us.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170072:3"/>
            <p>And as we acknowledge his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and mercy in puniſhing us, ſo we take notice of his wiſdome in chooſing ſuch inſtruments to puniſh us, men of mean and low rank and of common parts and abilities. By theſe he doth admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all the honourable, valiant, learned, and wiſe men of this nation; &amp; as it were write our ſin in the character of our puniſhment; and in the low condition of theſe inſtruments of his anger and diſpleaſure, the rod of his wrath, he would abate and puniſh our great pride.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Remembrancers,</hi> we have a double office on which we attend. The one, to call and cry unto God night and day, with humble prayers and teares, to be mercifull to his people, and to ſpare thoſe which he hath redeemed with his precious bloud, and not to be angry with them for ever. The other, to call and cry unto the whole nation, the proud and bold puniſhers with their vizours or formes of godlineſſe, as well as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:170072:3"/>to humble themſelves, to repent, to faſt, weep and mourn for our many and great wickedneſſes, eſpecially for our Pride.</p>
            <p>It may pleaſe God that, by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, this little book may prove as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigne poultiſe or medicine to aſſwage the ſwelling tumor of pride in the hearts of all them that will humble themſelves ſo farre as to read it. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids ſtone and ſling which ſlew proud Goliah, and by that meanes overthrew the pride and gallantry of a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, gives ſome encouragement to me, that even the pride of the Army, of the City, of the whole nation, may be in ſome meaſure leſſened and abated by this ſmall book: wherein the reader will find all the kindes and degrees of our pride plainly deſcribed, ſadly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſharply reproved; &amp; thereby the neceſſity and excellency of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace and ſweet vertue of <hi>Humility,</hi> affectionately perſwaded unto, and commended.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170072:4"/>
            <p>The God of power, wiſdome and mercy vouchſafe to give his bleſſing to this weak meanes, as prayeth</p>

The whole life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> on earth, was led for our inſtruction, and he was the Maſter, and teacher of all the virtues, but eſpecially of this of <hi>Humility,</hi> which he deſired cheifly, that we ſhould learn.

For indeed his whole life was an example, and lively pattern of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> diſcourſing of the whole life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> even from his birth, obſerves and ſhews, how all his actions ſerved to teach us this vertue in moſt particular manner. <hi>He would needs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be born of a mother who was poor in a poor open ſtable, and be layed in a manger, and be wrapped in miſerable clouts; be would needs be circumciſed like a ſinner, and fly into Egypt like a poor weak creature, and be baptized amongſt Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and ſinners, like one of them. And afterward in the courſe of his life, when they had a mind to do him honour, and take him up for their King, he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but when they put diſhonour, and affronts upon him, he then preſented himſelf to them: when he was honoured and admired by men, yea and even by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were poſſeſſed with the devill, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to hold their peace; but when they thought fit to reproach and ſcorn him, he held his peace. And neer the end of his life, that he might leave us this vertue by his laſt Will and Teſtament, he confirmed it by that ſo admirable example of waſhing his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples feet, as a ſo by undergoing that ſo ignominious death of the Croſſe.</hi> Saint Bernard ſaith, <hi>The Son of God abaſed and diminiſhed him elf, by taking our nature upon him, and he would have his whole life to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170072:8"/>be a pattern of</hi> Humility, <hi>ſo to teach us by actions, that which he would alſo teach us by words: A ſtrange manner of inſtruction. But why Lord muſt ſo high a Majeſty be abaſed ſo low? To the end that from henceforth there may not ſo much as one man be found, who ſhall once adventure to be proud, and to exalt himſelf upon the earth. It was ever a ſtrange boldnes, or rather a kind of madnes, for a man to be proud, but now (ſaith he) when the Majeſty of God hath humbled and abaſed it ſelf, it is an intollerable ſhame, and an unſpeakable kind of abſurdity, that this little wretched worm man, ſhould have a mind to be honoured and eſteemed: That the Son of God, who is equall to the Father, ſhould take the form of a ſervant upon him, and vouchſafe to be diſhonoured, and abaſed, and that I who am but duſt and aſhes. ſhould procure to be valued and admired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With much reaſon, did the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world declare that he is the maſter of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Humility,</hi> and that we were to learn it of him, for neither <hi>Plato,</hi> nor <hi>Socrates,</hi> nor <hi>Ariſiotle,</hi> did ever teach men this vertue. For when thoſe heathen Philoſophers, were treating of thoſe other vertues of fortitude, of temperance, of wiſdom, and of Juſtice, they were ſo far off the while from being humble therein, that they pretended even by thoſe very works, and by all their vertuous actions, to be eſteemed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to poſterity. It is true, that thee was a <hi>Diogenes,</hi> and ſome others like him, who profeſſed to contemn the world, and to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe themſelves, by uſing mean cloaths, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170072:9"/>certain other poverties and abſtinencies, but even in this, they were extreamly proud, and procured even by that means, to be obſerved and eſteemed, whilſt others were deſpiſed by them: as was wiſely noted by <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Diogenes.</hi> For one day, when <hi>Plato</hi> had invited certain Philoſophers, and amongſt them <hi>Diogenes</hi> to his houſe, he had his rooms well furniſhed, and his carpets laid, and ſuch other preparations made, as might be fit for ſuch gueſts. But as ſoon as <hi>Diogenes</hi> entred in, he began to foul thoſe fair carpets with his durty feet, which <hi>Plato</hi> obſerving, asked him what he meant. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Platonis faſtum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Diogenes;</hi> I am trampling ſaith he, upon <hi>Platos</hi> pride. But <hi>Plato</hi> made him this good anſwer, <hi>calcas ſed alio faſtu,</hi> thou tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt indeed, but with another kind of pride, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating thereby, that the pride wherewith he trod upon <hi>Platos</hi> carpets, was greater then <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos</hi> pride in poſſeſſing them.</p>
               <p>The Philoſophers did never reach to that contempt of themſelves, wherein Chriſtian <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> conſiſts, nay they did not ſo much as know <hi>humility,</hi> even by name, for this is that vertue which was properly, and only taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord.</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves, how that divine ſermon made by our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the Mount, began with this vertue; <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> For both Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others affirm, that by poor in ſpirit, ſuch as be humble are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. So that the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170072:9"/>his preaching with <hi>this,</hi> he continues it with <hi>this,</hi> and he ends it with <hi>this. This</hi> was he teaching us all his life, and <hi>this</hi> doth he deſire that we ſhould learn of him; He ſaid not (as Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> obſerves.) <hi>Learn of me to create heaven and earth, learn of me to do wonderful things, and to work miracles, to cure the ſick, to caſt out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and to revive the dead, but learn of me to be meek and humble of heart.</hi> For better is the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man who ſerves God, than he who works miracles. That other way is plain and ſafe, but this is full of ſtumbling blocks and dangers.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity which we have of this vertue of <hi>humility</hi> is ſo great, that without it, a man cannot make one ſtep into ſpirituall life. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>it is neceſſary that all our actions be very well accompanied, and fenced by humility, both in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi> for if we be negligent never ſo little, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vain complacence, and ſelf-pleaſing to enter in, the wind of pride carries all away. And it wil help-us little, that the work it ſelf be very good nay rather in good works, we have moſt cauſe to fear the vice of vain glory, and pride. For other vices have relation to ſins, and wicked objects, as envy, luxuriouſnes, and wrath, which carry a kind of ill ſuperſcription upon them, to the end, that we may take heed thereof; Whereas pride is ever treading as it were, upon the heels of good works, that ſo it may deſtroy them: A man goes proſperouſly ſayling with his heart raiſed up towards heaven, becauſe at
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170072:10"/>the beginning of the action, he had addreſſed it to the glory of God, and behold, when ſuddenly there comes a wind of vanity, and caſts him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rock, by procuring to make him deſire to pleaſe men, and to be honoured and eſteemed by them, taking ſome vain contentment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and therewith the whole buſineſſe ſinks: And ſo both Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſay very wel. <hi>He who aſſembles any other vertues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humility, is like a man who carries a little duſt or aſhes againſt the wind, in which caſe the wind will be ſure to ſcatter, and carry it all away.</hi>

Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> in one place, cals it the <hi>miſtris, and mother of all vertue;</hi> and he ſaith alſo in another place, <hi>that it is the root, and very off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of vertue.</hi> This metaphor, and compariſon of the root, is very proper, and doth very well declare the properties and conditions of <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:170072:10"/>For firſt he ſaith, that as the root ſuſtains and ſupports the flouer, and when the root is pluckt up, the flouer doth inſtantly dry, and withe, ſo every vertue whatſoever is inſtantly loſt, if it grows not up, and continues not in the root of <hi>humility.</hi> But as the root which lyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, and is trampled and trodden upon, hath no beauty or odour in it, and yet the tree receives life from thence, juſt ſo the humble man is buried, and diſ-eſteemed, and diſgraced, and ſeems to carry no luſtre nor brightnes in himſelf, but is caſt aſide into a corner, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; and yet this very thing is that, which conſerves him, and makes him thrive. But withall, as to the end that the tree may be able to grow, and continue, and bear much fruit, it is neceſſary that the root lye deep, and how much the more deep it is, and more covered with earth, ſo much the more fruit will the tree yeeld, and ſo much the longer will it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, according to that of the Prophet <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, It ſhall ſend the root downward, and make the fruit grow upward;</hi> ſo the fructifying of a ſoul in all vertue, &amp; the conſerving it ſelf therein conſiſts in laying a low root of <hi>humility.</hi> How much the more humble you are, ſo much the more will you profit &amp; grow in vertue, and perfection. To conclude, as pride is the beginning &amp; root of all ſin, according to the wiſe man, ſo <hi>humility</hi> is the foundation and root of all vertue.</p>
               <p>But ſome man will ſay perhaps, how can you affirm that <hi>humility</hi> is the foundation of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170072:11"/>and of all ſpirituall building, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we are taught by ſpirituall men, that faith is the foundation, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Other foundation can no man lay, than that is layed, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> that is faith in Jeſus Chriſt. To this <hi>Aquinas</hi> anſwers well. <hi>Two things are neceſſary for the well founding of a houſe, firſt it is neceſſary to open the ground well, and caſt out all that which is looſe, till at length you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to that which is firm, that ſo you may build af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward upon it, and when this is done,</hi> you begin to lay the firſt ſtone, which with the reſt then laid, is the principal foundation of the building After this manner ſaith <hi>Aquinas,</hi> do <hi>humility, and faith behave themſelves one towards another, in the ſpirituall building of vertue. Humility is that which opens the ſoyle, and the Office thereof is to dig deep into the earth, to caſt out all that which is looſe, which ſignifies the weaknes of mans power. So that you muſt not lay your foundation upon your own ſtrength; for all this is no better then ſand; all this is to be caſt out; diſtruſting your ſelves; and ſtill you muſt be digging on, till you come to the firm ſtone, and the living rock, which is Chriſt our Lord.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the principall foundation: but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, becauſe for the ſetling of this foundation, there is need alſo of that other, <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> is alſo called a foundation; And ſo he, who by means of <hi>humility,</hi> will open the ſoyl well, and dig deep into the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and caſt out all the ſand of his own eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and confidence in himſelf, will arrive to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170072:11"/>that true foundation, which is <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord,</hi> and this man will raiſe a good building, which will not be driven down, though the winds blow, and the waters beat, becauſe it is founded upon the firm rock. But on the other ſide, if he build without <hi>humility,</hi> the building will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſink down, becauſe it is founded upon ſand.</p>
               <p>They are not true vertues, but apparent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and falſe, which are not founded upon <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> And ſo Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 13. <hi>That in thoſe Romans, and antient Philoſophers, there was no true vertue, not only becauſe they wanted chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (which gives life, and being to all vertue, and without which, there is no true and perfect vertue,) but beſides, becauſe they wanted alſo the foundation of humility: and in their fortitude; temperance, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and juſtice, they deſired to be eſteemed, and to be talked of when they were dead; and ſo their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were but certain empty things, and without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and indeed they were but ſhadows, and ſhews of vertue. And ſo, as they were not perfect, and true, but only apparent, he ſaith, that God rewardeth the Romans for them with temporall bleſſings of this life, which are alſo bleſſings but of apparence. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you meant to build up true vertue, in your ſouls, procure firſt to ſay a deep foundation of humility therein. If you deſire (ſaith he) to be truly great, and to erect a high building of vertue in your hearts, you muſt open the ground very low.</hi> As much more high as a man means to raiſe this building, ſo much the lower muſt he lay his foundation.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170072:12"/>For there is no high without low; and after the proportion or rate, that you will dig deep, and lay the foundation of <hi>humility</hi> low; ſo much the higher will you be able to raiſe the Tower of Evangelicall perfection, which you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. <hi>Aquinas</hi> amongſt other grave ſentences, which are remembred to have been his, ſaid thus of <hi>Humility. He who goes on with deſire to be honoured, he who flies from being contemned, and if he be, is troubled at it, is far from perfection, though be ſhould work wonders,</hi> for in <hi>fine</hi> his vertue hath no foundation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Wherein it is declared more partieularly how humility is the foundation of all vertues, and this is done by diſcourſing of the cheif of them.</head>
               <p>TO the end, that it may the better be ſeen, how true this ſentence of the Saints is. That <hi>humility</hi> is the foundation of all, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and how neceſſary this foundation is for them all, we will breifly diſcourſe upon the cheif of them. And to begin with the Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall vertues, <hi>Humility</hi> is neceſſary towards faith. For faith ſuppoſeth a ſubmiſſe and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170072:12"/>underſtanding, <hi>ſubduing,</hi> (as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,) <hi>our underſtanding to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the faith of Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And ſo a proud underſtanding gives difficulty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, againſt the receiving of the ſaith, and Chriſt our redeemer declared as much to the Phariſes in this manner, <hi>How will you be able to believe, who receive glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rom one another, and ſeek not for that glory, which is of God alone? Joh:</hi> 5.44. And not only is <hi>humility</hi> neceſſary for the firſt receiving of faith, but for the conſervation alſo thereof. And it is generally the Doctrine of the Doctors and Saints, that pride is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all hereſies, when a man eſteems his opinion and judgment ſo much, that he prefers it before the common voice of the Saints, and of the Church, and ſo he comes to fall upon hereſies. And ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3. <hi>I give you to underſtand that in the latter dayes, there will be dangerous times, for men will be great l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vers of themſelves, covetous, puffed up, and proud,</hi> and he imputes hereſies to puffing up, and pride, as St: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> declares very well.</p>
               <p>The vertue alſo of hope, is conſerved, and maintained by <hi>humility,</hi> becauſe the humble man finds, and feels his neceſſity, and knows that of himſelf he can do nothing, and ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts to God more earneſtly, and places all his hope in him.</p>
               <p>Charity alſo and the love of God, is quickened and kindled by <hi>humility,</hi> becauſe the humble man knows, that whatſoever he hath, comes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170072:13"/>to him from the hand of God, and that himſelf is very far from deſerving it; and by this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration he is much inflamed towards the love of God. What is man (ſaid the holy <hi>Job,</hi>) that thou ſhouldeſt remember him, and ſet thy heart upon him, and vouchſafe him ſo many benefits and favours? I to be ſo wicked towards thee, and thou to be ſo good towards me, I to be ſo carneſt in offending thee day by day, and thou in doing me favours every hour. This is one of the moſt principall motives whereof the Saints have ever been wont to ſerve themſelves, that ſo they might be much inflamed with the love of God. For when they moſt conſidered their own indignity and miſery, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt obliged to ſerve God, who was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to place his eyes upon ſo great baſenes, (ſo ſaid the bleſſed Virgin.) <hi>My ſoul doth magnifie our Lord, becauſe he vouch ſafed to look upon the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his ſlave, or handmaid:</hi> As for the charity of men towards their neighbours, it is caſily to be ſeen, how neceſſary <hi>humility</hi> is. For one of thoſe things which is moſt wont to cool and leſſen our love to our Neighbours, is to judge of their faults, and to hold them to be full of imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and defects. But the <hi>humble</hi> man is very far from this, for his eyes are ever caſt in upon his own errors, and he never conſiders any thing in others but their vertues; and ſo he holds all other men to be good, and himſelf only to be imperfect, and faulty, and unworthy to live amongſt his brethren. And from hence is wont
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170072:13"/>to grow a great eſtimation, reſpect, and love to them all. Beſides, the <hi>humble</hi> man is not troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that all men ſhould be preferred before him, and that much accompt is made of them, and ſo himſelf alone is forgotten, or that things of greater moment are recommended to the care of others, and the leaſt and meaneſt to him.</p>
               <p>No envy hath any place amongſt humble men, for envy ſprings from pride, and therefore if there be <hi>humility,</hi> there will be no envy or contention, or any thing which may weaken a mans love to his neighbors.</p>
               <p>From <hi>humility</hi> alſo grows patience, which is neceſſary to all men in this life. For the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man acknowledges his faults and ſins, and conſiders himſelf to be worthy of any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and no affliction comes to him, which he eſteems to be leſſe than it ſhould have been, in reſpect of his faults, and ſo he holds his peace, and knows not how to complain, but rather ſaith with the Prophet <hi>Micha, I will ſuffer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly that puniſhment which God ſhall ſend me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſinned againſt him.</hi> And ſo, as the proud man is ever complaining, and ſtill thinks that men do him wrong, though they do him right, and that they treat him not as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves; ſo the man who is humble, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you do him wrong, perceives it not, and judges it not to be ſuch, nor doth he imagine that you ever give him any offence, nay rather it ſeems to him, that you let him live at a great
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170072:14"/>eaſe, and howſoever you proceed with him, he is very well ſatisfied, that you treat him better then he deſerves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humility</hi> is alſo a mighty means towards pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. And therefore the wiſe man adviſing him who means to ſerve Almighty God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf to ſuffer temptations, and diſguſts, and to arm himſelf with patience, aſſigns him for the means thereof, that he ſhould be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Carry thy heart abaſed, and then ſuffer. Receive all that in good part which comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, though it be very contrary to thy ſenſe and indure it though it put thee to pain. But how ſhall this be done? What kind of armour is that, which you mean to put upon me, to the end that I may not feel affliction; or if I feel it, that I may be able to ſupport it? Poſſeſſe <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and ſo you ſhall have patience.</p>
               <p>From <hi>humility</hi> doth alſo ſpring that kind of peace which is ſo much deſired by all, and which is ſo neceſſary for ſuch as are Religious. So ſaith Chriſt our Saviour. <hi>Be meek and humble, and you ſhall poſſeſſe great reſt and peace,</hi> both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your ſelves, and with your brethren. And as amongſt the proud there are ever contentions, and diſputes, and brauls, (ſaith the wiſe man) ſo amongſt ſuch as are <hi>humble,</hi> there can be no contention or ſtrife, except only that holy ſtrife and contention, who may be the inſeriour and may give all kind of honour and advantage to his Neighbour. Theſe are good contentions, and ſtrifes, which as they grow from true <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170072:14"/>and fraternal charity, ſo they alſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and conſerve the ſame.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Humility</hi> is alſo neceſſary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of chaſtity, we have many examples, in the hiſtories of the primitive times, where we read of ugly, and abominable fals of Men, who had already ſpent many of their years in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſolitary, &amp; penitential life, all which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from want of <hi>humility,</hi> &amp; from confiding and preſuming on themſelves; which God is wont to puniſh, by permitting men to fall into thoſe other ſins. <hi>Humility</hi> is alſo ſo great an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to chaſtity, that Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>I dare adventure to ſay, that even the virginity of the bleſſed Virgin Mary, would not have been pleaſing to God, without humility.</hi> Finally for the vertue of obedience, it is a cleer truth, that both he cannot be truly obedient, who is not humble, and that he who is humble, muſt needs be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. The humble Man may be commanded to do any thing, but ſo may not he, who is not humble. The humble Man frames no contrary judgments, but conforms himſelf in all things to his ſuperior, and not only in the work, but even in the will and underſtanding alſo; nor makes he any contradiction, or reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>If now we will come to ſpeak of prayer, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the very life of a religious, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man relies, if it be not accompanied with <hi>humility,</hi> it is of no worth; Whereas prayer with <hi>humility</hi> pierces heaven. <hi>The prayer of him who humbles himſelf, doth penetrate heaven,</hi> ſaith the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170072:15"/>wiſe man; and he will not give over till he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all that which he deſires at the hands of God. That holy and humble <hi>Judith,</hi> being ſhut up in her Oratory, clad with ſackcloath, and covered with aſhes, and proſtrate upon the earth, cries out in theſe words. <hi>The prayer of the humble, and meek of heart was ever pleaſing to thee O Lord.</hi> God beheld the prayer of the humble, and deſpiſed not their Petitions. Never think that the humble man ſhall be driven away, or depart out of countenance, he ſhal obtain what he asks, God will hear his prayer. Do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how highly that humble prayer of the Publican in the Goſpel pleaſed God; he who preſumed not ſo much as to lift up his eyes to heaven, but diſpoſing himſelf far of, into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Temple, and knocking his breſt with humble acknowledgment of himſelf, ſaid; <hi>O Lord have mercy upon me, for I am a greivous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I tell you of a truth</hi> (ſaith Jeſus Chriſt our redeemer) <hi>that this man went juſtified out of the Temple,</hi> and that proud Phariſee, who held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a Saint, went condemned. In this very manner might we diſcourſe of the reſt of the vertues, and therefore if you deſire to go the next way, for the getting of them all, and to learn a ſhort and compendious document, for the ſpeedy obtaining of perfection, this is it; <hi>Be humble.</hi>

               <p>BY how much thou art greater, ſee thou humble thy ſelf (ſaith the wiſe man) ſo much the more, and thou ſhalt find grace in the ſight of God. We who make profeſſion to gain ſouls to God, may ſay (for our confuſion) that God hath called us to a very high ſtate; ſince our office is to ſerve the Church, in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain miniſteries, which are very eminent, and high, even the ſame, to which God choſe the Apoſtles; namely, the preaching of the Goſpel, the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and the diſpenſation of his body and blood, ſo that we may ſay with Saint <hi>Paul, God hath given us the miniſtery of reconciliation.</hi> He cals the preaching of the Goſpel, and the diſpenſation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, by which grace is communicated, the miniſtery of reconciliation. God hath made us his ſervants, his Embaſſadors, (as his Apoſtles were the firſt) of that cheif Biſhop Jeſus Chriſt tongues &amp; inſtruments of the holy Ghoſt. God exhorting, and perſwading men by us. Our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170072:16"/>
                  <hi>Lord</hi> is pleaſed to ſpeak to ſouls by our tongues, by theſe tongues of fleſh, will our <hi>Lord</hi> move the hearts of men, for this have we therefore more need than others, of the vertue of <hi>Humility,</hi> and that upon two reaſons, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by how much the more high our Office, and vocation is, ſo much more hazard ſhall we run, and ſo much the greater will be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of vanity and pride. <hi>The higheſt hils</hi> (as St: <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith) <hi>are aſſaulted by the higheſt winds.</hi> We are imployed in very high Miniſteries, and for this are we reſpected and eſteemed over the world. We are held to be <hi>Saints,</hi> and even for other Apoſtles upon earth, and that all our converſation is ſanctity, (ſo by all means it ought to be, and woe unto us if it be not) and that our ſtudy is to make them alſo Saints, with whom we converſe? Here is need of a great foundation of <hi>Humility,</hi> that ſo high a building as this, may not be driven down to the ground. We had need have great ſtrength of vertue, that we may be able to bear the weight of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with all the circumſtances thereof. A hard taſk it is, to walk in the midſt of honours, and that yet no part thereof ſhould faſten it ſelf to the heart. It is not every bodies caſe, to have a head that can be ſafe ſo high. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have grown giddy, and fallen down from that high ſtate wherein they were, for want of the foundation of <hi>Humility?</hi> how many who ſeemed Eagles, towring up in the exerciſe of ſeverall vertues, have through pride, become as blind as Bats.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170072:16"/>
               <p>For this do we therefore ſtand in particular need to be very well grounded in this vertue, for if we be not, we ſhall run great hazzard of being giddy, and of falling into the ſin of pride; yea and that the greateſt of all others, ſpirituall pride. <hi>Bonaventure declaring this, ſaith; That there are two kinds of pride, one which concerns temporall things, and this is called carnall pride, and another which concerns things ſpirituall, and this is called ſpirituall pride, and ſo ſaith, that this ſecond is a greater pride, and a greater ſin than the former,</hi> The reaſon hereof is clear, for as he ſaith, <hi>the proud man is a theef, and commits robbery, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>or he runs away with the goods of another, againſt the will of the owner;</hi> by having ſtollen the honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is proper to <hi>God,</hi> and which he will not give away, but reſerve to himſelf. My glory I will not give to another (ſaith he by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſay</hi>) and this doth the proud man ſteal from God, and he runs away with it, and applies it to himſelf. Now when a man grows proud of any naturall advantage, as of nobility, of agility, and ſtrength of body, of quicknes of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, of learning, or the like, this man is a robber, but yet the theft is not ſo great. For though it be true, that all theſe bleſſings are of God, they are yet but as the chaffe of his houſe; but he who ſhall grow proud of his ſpirituall gifts, as namely of ſanctity, or of the fruit which is gathered by gaining ſouls, this is a great theef, a robber of the honour of God, and who ſteals thoſe jewels which he eſteems the moſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170072:17"/>rich, and of the greateſt price, and value, and which indeed were ſet at ſo high a rate, that he thought his own blood and life, wel imployed upon the purchaſe thereof. For this reaſon, a certain holy Father being full of care, and fear leſt he ſhould fall into pride, was wont to ſay thus to <hi>God.</hi> O <hi>Lord</hi> if thou give me any thing, keep it for me; who dare not truſt my ſelf with it, for I am no better then a theef, and am ſtill running away with thy goods. And now let us alſo walk on with the ſame fear, ſince we have much more reaſon to be afraid, and are far from being ſo humble as he was. Let us not fall into this ſo dangerous pride, let us not run away with thoſe goods of <hi>God,</hi> which he hath put with ſo much confidence into our hands. Let no part thereof ſtick to us, let us artribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our ſelves, but return the whole back to God. It was not without great miſtery, that Chriſt our Saviour when he appeared to his Diſciples upon the day of his glorious Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reprov'd them firſt for their incredulity, and hardneſſe of heart, and commanded them afterward to go and preach the Goſpel throughout the whole world, and gave them power to work many, and mighty miracles. For he gives us thereby to underſtand, that he who is to be exalted to the doing of great things, hath need to be humbled firſt, and to be abaſed in himſelf, and to have a true knowledge of his own faculties, and miſeries, that ſo though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he come to great perfection, he may
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170072:17"/>yet remain ſtill intire in the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſtick faſt to the underſtanding of his own baſenes, without attributing any other thing to himſelf then unworthineſſe. <hi>Theodoret</hi> to this purpoſe notes, that God reſolving to chuſe <hi>Moſes</hi> for their Captain, and conductor of his People, and to work by his means, ſuch wondrous and admirable things, as he reſolved to let the world ſee, thought fit for the cauſe aforeſaid, that firſt, that very hand wherewith he was to divide the Red Sea, and effect other things ſo very ſtrange, being firſt put into his boſome, ſhould be then drawn forth, and ſeen by himſelf to be full of leproſie.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon, for which we ſtand in more particular neceſſity of <hi>Humility,</hi> is to the end, that we may gather fruit in thoſe very mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries wherein we are imployed, ſo that <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> is neceſſary for us, not only in regard of our own improvement, leſt otherwiſe we ſhould grow vain and proud, and ſo caſt away our ſelves; but beſides, for the gaining of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hours, and the bringing forth fruit in their ſouls. One of the moſt principal means towards this end is <hi>Humility,</hi> and that we diſtruſt our ſelves, and that we rely not upon our own indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, or prudence, or other parts, but that we place all our confidence in <hi>God,</hi> and aſcribe, and refer all to him, according to that of the wiſe man: <hi>Put your confidence in God with your whole heart, and rely not upon your own prudence.</hi> And the reaſon hereof is (as afterward I ſhall declare
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170072:18"/>more at large) becauſe when through diſtruſt of our ſelves, we place all our confidence in God, we aſcribe it all to him, and put the whole buſines to his accompt, whereby we oblige him much, to take care thereof. O Lord diſpatch thine own buſines, the converſion of ſouls is thine, and not ours, alas what power can we have to ſave fouls? But now when we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the means we uſe, and in the diſcourſes which we are able to make, we bring our ſelves to be parties to the buſines, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute much to our ſelves, and all that we do, we take from Almighty God. They are like two balances, for look how much the one riſes, ſo much the other will be ſure to fall, as much as we attribute to our ſelves, ſo much we take from <hi>God,</hi> and run away with the glory, and honour which is only his, and thus he comes to permit, that no effect is wrought. And I pray God that this be not ſometimes the cauſe, why we do our Neighbours no more good.</p>
               <p>We read of many Preachers in former times, and remember ſome of our own time, who though they were not very learned men, no nor very eloquent, yet by their Preaching, Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and private communications in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and low way, have converted, quickened, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and ſtrengthened many of their flock, not in the perſwading words of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but in the manifeſtation of ſpirit, and truth, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They were diſtruſtfull of themſelves, and placed all their confidence in God,</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:170072:18"/>and ſo <hi>God</hi> gave ſtrength, &amp; ſpirit to their words which ſeemed even to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt burning ſlames into the hearts of their hearers. And now I know not whether the reaſon why we produce not at this day, ſo great fruit, be not becauſe we ſtick much cloſer to the opinion of our own prudence, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we reſt, and rely much upon our own means of perſwaſion, and our learning, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and our polite, and elegant manner of declaring our minds, and we go guſting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting our ſelves much with our ſelves. O well then ſaith God, when you conceive that you have ſaid the beſt thing, and delivered the moſt convincing reaſons, and remain content, and jolly, with conceit that you have done great matters, you ſhall then effect leaſt of all. And that ſhall be fulfilled in you, which the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> ſaid, <hi>give them a barren womb, and dry breaſts;</hi> I will take order that thou ſhalt be a barren Mother, and thou ſhalt have no more thereof but the name, I will give you dry breaſts, ſuch as no child ſhall hang upon, nor any thing ſtick by them which thou ſayeſt, for this doth he deſerve, who will needs uſurp the goods of God, and attribute that to himſelf, which is proper, and only due to his <hi>divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> I ſay not, but whatſoever Men ſhall preach, muſt be very well ſtudied, and conſidered, but yet this is not all, for it muſt alſo be very well wept upon, and very well recommended to God, and when you ſhall have made your head ake with ſtudying it, and ruminating upon it,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170072:19"/>you muſt ſay, <hi>We have but done what we ought, and we are unprofitable ſervants,</hi> what am I able to effect, I have made a little noiſe of words, like a peece which ſhoots powder without a bullet, but if the heart be wounded, it is thou O Lord who muſt do it. The Kings heart is in Gods hand, and he inclines it to whatſoever he will. It is thou O Lord who art to move, and wound the heart, alas what are we able to do to them? What proportion can our words, &amp; all our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane means carry, to an end ſo high, and ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, as it is to convert ſouls? No ſuch matter. But how comes it then to paſſe, that we are ſo vain, and ſo well pleaſed with our ſelves, when we think ſome good is done, and that our buſines ſucceeds well, as if we were the men who had done the deed, <hi>ſhall peradventure</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> to God) the Hatchet or the ſaw brag againſt him who uſes it, and works with it, and ſay I am he who have cut, and who have ſawed that wood: This were, as if a cudgell ſhould look big, and admire it ſelf, becauſe a man lifts it up, whereas the thing in it ſelf is but wood, which cannot once ſtir, if men ſtir it not. Now we are juſt thus, in reſpect of any ſpirituall, and ſupernaturall end of the converſion of ſouls. We are like ſo many wands, who cannot once ſtir, if God ſtirs not, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt aſcribe all to him, as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to brag of in our ſelves.</p>
               <p>God doth ſo much eſteem, that we rely not upon our own ſtrength, or humane diligence,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170072:19"/>and that we ſhould take nothing to our ſelves, but aſcribe all to him, and give him the glory of all, that St: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that for this reaſon, Chriſt our Lord would not make choice of eloquent and learned men, for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the world, by the Preaching of the Goſpel but of poor Fiſhermen, who were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and rude, God made choice of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and groſſe People to confound the wiſe of the world, he choſe the poor and weak to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the mighty and ſtrong, he choſe the mean and baſe, who ſeemed to be nothing in the eyes of fleſh and blood, to ſubdue Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and all the Grandes of the earth. But know you why, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to the end, that man may not, go bragging in the ſight of God, nor take occaſion of aſcribing any thing to himſelf, but give all the glory of all to God. If the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel were very rich and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and went with great troops, and ſtrong hand to preach Gods word over the world, they might perhaps impute mens converſion to the force of their arms. If God had choſen the great learned men, and the moſt excellent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators of the world, who by their learning, and eloquence, might convince the Philoſophers, a man might have attributed the converſion of mankind to curioſity of ſpeech, and ſubtilty of arguments, in diminution of the credit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the vertue and power of Chriſt our Lord. But it muſt not be after this manner, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> God was not pleaſed, that this great
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170072:20"/>buſines ſhould be carried by eloquence of ſpeech, or humane wiſdom, leſt the eſtimation of the power, and efficacy of the croſſe, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt our Lord ſhould ſuffer pre judice thereby, St: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> reſolving to humble the necks of the proud, did not by means of Orators gain Fiſhermen, but by means of Fiſhermen gained both Orators, and Emperors. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was a great Orator, but Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Fiſherman was before him, by means of whom was converted, not only the Orator, but even the Emperor.</p>
               <p>The holy Scripture is full of examples, to ſhew that God is wont to chuſe weak means, and inſtruments for the doing of mighty things, to teach us this truth, and to the end, it might remain deeply fixed in our hearts, that we have nothing whereof to glory, or to aſcribe to our ſelves, but abſolutely all to God. This are we alſo taught by that illuſtrious victory of <hi>Judith,</hi> which ſhe being a weak woman, obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Army of above a hundred and forty thouſand men. This are we alſo taught, by that poor little ſhepheard <hi>David,</hi> who being but a boy, and with no other weapon but his ſling, beat down that Giant <hi>Goliah,</hi> and triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Philiſtines. To the end, that the whole world (ſaith he) may know that there is a <hi>God</hi> in Iſrael, and that all men may underſtand, that God hath no need either of ſword, or launce for the obtaining of Victory, (for battels in fine are his, and victory is his) and that men may be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170072:20"/>ſure of this, he gives it when he will, without arms.</p>
               <p>This was alſo the miſtery of <hi>Gideon,</hi> who had drawn two and thirty thouſand men together againſt the Midianites, who were more the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a hundred and thirty thouſand men, and God ſaid thus to him, <hi>Gideon</hi> thou haſt great ſtore of People with thee, but Midian ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up into thy hands. Conſider what a ſtrange diſcourſe of God this is, thou ſhalt not overcome, becauſe thou haſt much People with thee. If he had ſaid thou cauſt not overcome them becauſe they are ſo many, and thou haſt ſo few, it ſeems that the diſcourſe had been ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; but you are deceived, and underſtand not the buſines, this had been a good reaſon for men to alledg, but that other was proper to God alone, you cannot overcome ſaith God, becauſe you are many, but why ſo? To the end that Iſrael may not glorifie it ſelf againſt me, and ſo ſteal the victory from me, and become vain and proud, as conceiving that it was conquered by the ſtrength thereof. God carried the matter ſo, as that there only remained three hundred men with <hi>Gideon,</hi> and commanded that he ſhould then preſent battel to the Enemy, and with them he gave <hi>Gideon</hi> the victory, yea, and they had not ſo much as need to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in arms, or to take their ſwords into their hands, but with the only ſound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets which they carried in one of their hands, and with the noiſe of breaking certain pots, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170072:21"/>with the brightnes of the flaming torches which they carried in the other, God ſtruck the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with ſuch a terror, and amazement, that they overwhelmed and killed one another, and the reſt put themſelves to flight, as thinking that the whole world was coming upon them, then the others could not ſay that they had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by their own ſtrength, and this was that which God deſired, namely, that they might be forced to acknowledg him the only giver of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. If then, even in temporall, and humane things, wherein our own diligences, and means, carry ſome kind of proportion towards the end as our arms, and forces do towards the obtaining of victory, God will not yet permit, that we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any thing to our ſelves, but that we muſt aſcribe the victory of a battell, and indeed the good ſucceſſe of all affairs to him, if even in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, neither he who plants, nor he who waters is any thing, and it is not the gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who can make any plant grow, nor make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tree give fruit, but only God, what ſhall we ſay of ſpirituall and ſupernaturall things, of the converſion of ſouls, of a mans own profit and increaſe in vertue, wherein our means, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and diligences remain ſo ſhort, and ſo far behind, as that they carry no proportion at all with ſo high an end? The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, God only is he who can give increaſe, and ſpirituall fruit, God only is he who can ſtrike the hearts of men with amazement, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fear, God only is he who can make men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170072:21"/>ſin, and forſake wickedneſſe of life. And as for us, we can only make a little noiſe with the trumpet of the Goſpel, and if we ſhall break theſe earthen pots of our bodies with mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and if men may be able to ſee the light of a very exemplar life ſhine in us, we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have done our parts, but yet ſtill it is only God who muſt give us the victory.</p>
               <p>Let us gather, and draw two things from hence, that ſo we may exerciſe our functions with much comfort, and with the profit both of our ſelves, and our neighbors.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that whereof we have already ſpoken, to diſtruſt our ſelves, to place all our confidence in God, and to attribute the whole fruit and good ſucceſſe of all things to him. St: <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let us not wax proud, but let us confeſſe our ſelves to be unprofitable, that ſo we may grow to be profitable, and uſefull</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>if you will produce much fruit amongſt your neighbors,</hi> obſerve the rule which we are taught by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> He who ſpeaks, let him make account, that God put theſe words into his mouth, he who works, let him make account that it is God who works by him, and let him give the honour and glory of it all to him. Let us not aſcribe any thing to our ſelves, nor run away with ſtrange conceit, nor take any vain contentment in the act.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which we are to fetch from hence, is that we be not diſanimated or deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when we conſider our own wretchednes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170072:22"/>and miſery. Of this we have alſo great need, for who obſerving himſelf to be called to ſo high an Office, and to ſo ſupernaturall an end, as it is to convert ſouls, to draw them out of ſin, out of hereſies, out of infidelity, who I ſay conſidering this, will not faint under the thought, and ſay, O Jeſus how great a diſproportion is this? Such an imployment fits not well with me, who am the moſt needy and miſerable creature of all others. But yet in this you are deceived, for even for this very reaſon, this enterprize is fit for you, <hi>Moſes</hi> could not beleeve that he was ever to perform ſo great a work, as to draw the people of Iſrael out of the captivity of Aegypt, and he excuſed himſelf thus to God who was deſirous to ſend him: <hi>What am I that I ſhould go treat with the King, and procure him to let the people of Iſrael depart out of Egypt? ſend him O Lord whom you are to ſend, for as for me I am a ſtammerer, and unfit for the imployment.</hi> This is that (ſaith God) which ſerves my turn, it is not thou ſhalt do it, I will be with thee, and I will teach thee what thou art to ſay. The ſame hapned alſo to the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> whom God ſent to preach to the world, but he began to excuſe himſelf thus. <hi>A. A. A.</hi> do you not ſee O Lord, that I can hardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my words, but am a very child, and how then will you have me undertake ſo great an enterpriſe as this? Even for this very reaſon, he will uſe thee, and thou art juſt the man he ſeeks and perhaps if thou wert indued with many parts, God would not have choſen thee to this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170072:22"/>end, but now thou ſhalt have no colour to ſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> the praiſe, and attribute any thing to thy ſelf, and by ſuch weak inſtruments, is he deſirous to do great things.</p>
               <p>The holy Evangeliſts recount that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles coming from preaching, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> obſerving the fruit which they had gathered, and the wonderfull things which they had wrought, did highly rejoyce in the Holy Ghoſt, and gave great thanks, and glorified his eternal Father. <hi>I give thee thanks O eternall Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, for that thou haſt hidden theſe things from the wiſe and prudent of the world, and haſt revealed and communicated them to thy little ones, and by their means doſt work ſo great wonders.</hi> Bleſſed and praiſed be thou <hi>O Lord</hi> for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt been pleaſed to do thus. O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py little ones, happy humble ſouls, for theſe are they whom God exalts, and by whom he works wonders, and whom he takes for his inſtruments in doing great things, in working great conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and gathering great fruit of ſouls, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no man be diſcouraged or diſmaid. Be not afraid little flock, be not diſanimated, or put out of heart, becauſe thou ſeeſt thy ſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, and leaſt of all others, for it hath been pleaſing to your heavenly Father, to give you power over the hearts and ſouls of men. <hi>I will be with you</hi> (ſaid Chriſt our Saviour) <hi>I will aſſiſt you unto the end of the world,</hi> let us then hold for certain, that Jeſus will ever be our ſuccour, as himſelf promiſed to our Fathers the bleſſed-Apoſtles,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170072:23"/>and that we ſhall ever have him for our conductor, and Captain, and therefore let us not grow weary, or be diſcouraged in this ſo great affair of helping ſouls, to which God hath called us.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the firſt degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> which is for a man to think meanly of himſelf.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>LAurentius Juſtinianus</hi> ſaith, <hi>that no man knows well what humility is, but he who hath received the gift of being humble from God.</hi> It is really a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard thing to be known. A man ſaith, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf in nothing more, then in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he knows what true <hi>Humility</hi> is. Do you think it conſiſts in ſaying, I am a miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creature, I am proud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If it conſiſted in this, the thing were eaſie enough, and we ſhould all be humble, for we all ſay of our ſelves, that we are this, and we are that, and I pray God that we may all ſpeak as we think, and that we may not ſay it with the mouth alone, and by way of complement, do you think that <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> conſiſts in wearing poor, and mean cloaths, or in imploying our ſelves about object, and contemptible things? It conſiſts not in this, for herein may be much pride, and as man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170072:23"/>to be much eſteemed, and valued even for this, and to hold himſelf to be better, and more humble then others, which is the height of pride. True it is, that theſe exterior things do help toward true <hi>humility,</hi> if they be uſed as they ought, (whereof I ſhall ſay more afterward,) but yet in fine <hi>Humility</hi> doth not conſiſt in this. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>many follow the apparence, and ſhadow of Humility, few the truth.</hi> An eaſie thing it is, to carry the head bowed down, the eyes low, the ſpeech ſubmiſſe, and ſoft, to ſigh often, and at every word to be calling themſelves mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and ſinfull creatures, but yet if you touch theſe very men with any little word, though it be but very lightly, you ſhall inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be able to ſee how far they are from true <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi> Let all feigned words be laid aſide, away with Hipocriſies, and exterior ſhews, for the true humble man (ſaith he) is ſhewed by his ſufferance, and patience. This is that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, whereby true <hi>Humility</hi> is diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> deſcends more particularly to declare, wherein this vertue conſiſts, and gives us this definition thereof. <hi>Humility is a vertue, whereby a man moſt truly diſcerning, and obſerving his own defects, and miſeries, holds himſelf in ſmall account.</hi> Humility conſiſts not in exterior things or words, but in the very root of the heart, in a mans thinking moſt baſely of himſelf, and both in holding himſelf, and in deſiring to be held by others, in very mean account, and ſo as that this muſt riſe out of a moſt profound knowledg of himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:170072:24"/>
               <p>To declare, and as it were anatomiſe this truth, the antient Fathers ſet down many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Humility. Aquinas</hi> aſſigneth twelve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of this vertue. Saint <hi>Anſelm</hi> ſpeaks of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> reduces them to three, and we will now follow this laſt, both for brevities ſake, and to the end, that reſtraining this Doctrine to fewer points, we may the more eaſily keep them before our eyes, and ſo procure to put them in execution. The firſt degree therefore of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bonaventure</hi>) is, <hi>that a man think meanly of himſelf,</hi> and have himſelf in ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and the neceſſary, and only means to this, is the knowledg of a mans ſelf. Theſe two things be they, which the definition of <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> aſſigned by Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> comprehends, and ſo it only reaches to the firſt degree. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>Humllity</hi> is a vertue, wherby a man holds himſelf in mean account.</p>
               <p>This is then the firſt, and this ſaith St: <hi>Bernard, is wrought in man, by his having a true knowledg of himſelf, and of his miſeries, and defects.</hi> For this cauſe, ſome are wont to put the knowledg of a mans ſelf, for the firſt degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> and they do it with great reaſon. But yet, for as much as we reduce al the degrees to three, with <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> we put for the firſt degree, the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a mans ſelf in ſmall account, and we put the knowledg of a mans ſelf, for the neceſſary means whereby to attain this degree of <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but yet in ſubſtance all is one. We all agree in this, that the knowledg of a mans ſelf, is the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170072:24"/>beginning, and foundation, whereby <hi>Humility</hi> is to be obtained, and the thinking of our ſelves as we deſerve. For how can we think of a man as he deſerves, if we know him not. This cannot be, it is therefore neceſſary, firſt that we know what any man is, and then we may eſteeme, or honour him more or leſſe, according to what we know of him. So that ſtill you muſt firſt know what you are, and afterward according to what you are, you may eſteem your ſelves, and you ſhall have good leave to do ſo, for if you eſteem your ſelves for what you are, you will be very humble, for you will eſteem your ſelves very little, but if you eſteem your ſelves more then you deſerve, that will be pride. Saint <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> ſaith, <hi>Superhus dictus eſt, quia ſuper vult vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quam eſt.</hi> Therefore is a man called proud, be cauſe he holds himſelf, and deſires to be held by others, for more then he is, and this is one of the reaſons which ſome aſſigne, why God loves <hi>Humility</hi> ſo much, becauſe he is a great lover of truth; and <hi>Humility</hi> is ttuth, and pride is a deceit, and a lye, for you are not that which you think of your ſelves, and which you deſire that others ſhould think you to be. If therefore you reſolve to walk in truth, and in <hi>Humility,</hi> eſteem your ſelves for what you are. Me thinks I ask no great matter of you, in deſiring that you will eſteem your ſelves for what you are, and not for what you are not. For it is a very unreaſonable thing for any man to eſteem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for more then he is, And it would not only
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170072:25"/>be a great deceit, but a great danger withall, ſo any man to be deceived in himſelf, eſteeming himſelf for other, then indeed he is.</p>

               <p>LEt us begin to ſound, and dig deep into our ſelves, and into the knowledg of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and miſery, that ſo we may diſcover this moſt rich treaſure, (ſaith St. <hi>Hierome.</hi>) In the very dung of your baſenes, and of your infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſins, you ſhall find that pretious pearl of <hi>Humility.</hi> Let us begin with our corporall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; let that be the firſt preſſing of the ſpade, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith. <hi>Set theſe things ever before thine eyes, what thou wert, what thou art, and what thou art to be. Have ever before thine eyes, what thou waſt before thou wert ingendred, which was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thing ſo ſtinking, and ſo filthy, as that we may not give it the true name. What art thou now? Thou art a veſſell full of dung: what art thou to be ſhortly; but the food of worms?</hi> We have here matter enough to meditate upon, and to dig into. O
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170072:25"/>baſe, and vile condition of humane nature. Look upon the trees, and plants, &amp; thou ſhalt find that they produce beautifull leaves, and flowers, and fruits, but man proceeds out of himſelf nits, lice, and worms. The plants, and trees yeeld out of themſelves Oyl, Balſamum, and wine, and odours alſo of much ſweetneſſe; and a man utters a thouſand uncleaneſſes, of ſo abominable ſavour, as makes ones ſtomach turn to think of it, and much more to name it. But in fine, ſuch as the tree is, ſuch is the fruit like to be, for an ill tree can bear no good fruit.</p>
               <p>Verily, the Fathers do with much reaſon, and with great propriety, compare the body of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to a dunghil overcaſt with ſnow, which on the outſide appears beautifull, and fair, but within is full of uglines, and uncleaneſſe. The bleſſed St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid, If you put your ſelves to conſider what you vent by your eyes, your ears, your mouth, your noſtrils, and the other ſinks of your body, there is not in the whole world, any other ſo filthy dunghill, nor which utters ſuch abomination as this. O how well ſaid the holy <hi>Job? What is man but rottenneſſe it ſelf, and a very fountain of worms, I have ſaid to rottenneſſe thou art my Father, and to the worms I have ſaid you are my mother, and my brethren.</hi> Such a thing as this is man, a very running ſtream of rotteneſſe, and a wide ſack full of worms, Wel then, of what ſhall we now be proud? Of what will duſt, and aſhes take
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170072:26"/>occaſion to brag? At leaſt from hence, we ſhall be able to diſcover no colour for being proud, but enough for being humble, and to deſpiſe our ſelves. And therefore Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>It will help us to conſerve Humility, if we remember our own deformity,</hi> it will keep very ſafe under theſe aſhes.</p>
               <p>Let us paſs yet a little further on, and dig yet deeper, and preſs the ſpade yet lower into the ground. Conſider what you were before God created you, and you ſhall find that you were juſt nothing, and that you could never have been delivered out of that dark depth of being nothing, if God through his great mercy and goodnes, had not taken you out from thence, and placed you amongſt his creatures, giving you that real, and true being, which you now enjoy. So that, for as much as is on our parts, we are nothing, and we are to hold our ſelves but equall to thoſe things which are not, and we muſt aſcribe to God, that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which now we have above them. This is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man think he is any thing, he is deceived, for of himſelf he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> We have here diſcovered a great deep mine, whereby to enrich our ſelves with <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi> Yea, and there is yet more in this, for even now after we ate created, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived our being, it is not we who hold it, and can contain it in our ſelves. It is not, as when the archirect hath built a houſe, which ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains it ſelf when he hath left it, without
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170072:26"/>needing him any more who made it. It is not ſo in our caſe, but now after we are created, we have ſtill as great need of God, in every moment of our lives, to the end that we may not looſe the being which we have already, as we had, whilſt we were nothing, that we might grow to be. He is ever ſuſtaining, and holding us up, with his hand of power, that ſo we may not again fall down, into that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found pit of being nothing, out of which he took us before. And ſo ſaith <hi>David: Thou O Lord didſt frame me, and thou didſt place thy hand upon me; and this hand of thine O Lord, holds me ſtill faſt on foot, and conſerves me, that ſo I may not again return to my former nothing.</hi> We are ever ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, and ſo hanging upon this hand-faſt of God, that if once this ſhould fail us, and that he ſhould take off that hand, but for any one moment of our lives, in the ſame very moment we were diſpatched, and we ſhould looſe our being, and ſo return to our nothing, as when the Sun is once hidden, the earth is dark.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon ſaith the holy Scripture. <hi>All Nations in the ſight of God, are as if they were not, and as nothing, and they are meer emptines it ſelf before him:</hi> This is that which we all are ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every minute, namely, that we are nothing but yet I doubt that we ſay it only with our mouths, for I know not whether we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what we ſay. O that we underſtood and felt it, as the Prophet underſtood, and felt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170072:27"/>it, when he ſaid thus to <hi>God, I O Lord am as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in thy fight:</hi> Really, for my part I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for I had no being, and the being which now. I have, was not had by me of my ſelf, but thou O <hi>Lord</hi> didſt give it me, and to thee muſt I aſcribe it all, and I have nothing whereof to brag, or glory in my ſelf, for I had nothing at all to do therein; and thou O Lord art ever conſerving me in being, and holding me ſtill faſt on foot, and thou art ſtill giving me ſtrength wherewith to work, all being, all ſtrength, all power to work, comes to us from thy hand, for on our part we can do nothing, and we are worth nothing, and in fine, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo that now of what ſhall we be able to wax proud? Will it be perhaps of the nothing which we ſee, we have? We ſaid a while ago, of what doſt thou grow proud, O thou who art but duſt and aſhes, but now we may ſay of what doſt thou grow proud, O thou who art nothing, which is leſs then duſt and aſhes? What occaſion, or even colour can a thing of nothing take, for looking big, and growing proud, and holding it ſelf in ſome account? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falliby none at all.</p>

               <p>LEt us yet go farther on, and dig, and ſound deeper in the knowledg of our ſelves. Let us uſe the ſpade once again. But what is there any thing yet deeper, doth any thing lye lower then nothing? yes there doth, and much lower. What, the ſin which you have added to it, O what a deep pit is this? it is much deeper then nothing, for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is much worſe then not being, and it were better for a man not to be, then to have ſinned, and ſo ſaid <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Judas,</hi> who meant to ſell him, it had been better for him that he had not been born. There is not a place ſo low, ſo diſtant, and ſo deſpiſed in the eyes of God, amongſt all thoſe things which either are, or are not, as that man who lives in ſin, without repentance, he is diſ-inherited of Heaven, the enemy of God, and ſentenced for all eternity to Hell-fire, and though now, through the goodnes of our <hi>Lord,</hi> your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170072:28"/>are not charged with the allowance of any known ſin; yet as for the knowledg of our nothing, ye called to mind that time, wherein we had no being, ſo for the knowing of our baſenes, and miſery, we are now to call that time to mind, when we were in ſin. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in how wretched eſtate you were, when in the ſight of God you were ungratious, ugly, his enemies, the children of wrath, obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to eternall torments, and then deſpiſe your ſelves throughly, and abaſe your ſelves into the loweſt &amp; profoundeſt place that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly you can, for you may ſafely beleeve, that how much ſoever you humble, and deſpiſe your ſelves, you will never be able to arrive to that depth of contempt, which he deſerves, who hath offended that infinite goodnes, which is God. This buſines hath no bottom at al, it is a moſt profound, and infinite depth, for till we ſhall be able to ſee in heaven, how good God is, we ſhall never be able to know perfectly, how great an il ſin is, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God, and how great a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he deſerves who commits it.</p>
               <p>O that we would continue in this medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and dig on, and ſtill ſound deeper into this mine of our ſins, and miſeries, how hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would we then be; in how ſmall account would we hold our ſelves; and how eaſily would we admit to be diſ-eſteemed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by all. He who hath been a traytor to God, what contempt will he not endure for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170072:28"/>his love? He who gave God away for a fancy or toy, or for ſom pleaſure of an inſtant: he who offended his Creator, and his <hi>Lord,</hi> and deſerved to remain for ever in hel; what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honors, what affronts, or injuries wil not he be glad to receive, and accept them as gentle chaſtiſements for thoſe offences, which he hath committed againſt the majeſtie of God; as ſaid the Prophet <hi>David. Before that ſcourge came wherewith God humbled and afflicted me, I had given him cauſe to inflict it; I had already ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and therefore now I am ſilent, nor dare I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, for all is much leſs than my ſins deſerved. Thou haſt not puniſhed me O Lord, according to my offences,</hi> for whatſoever we are poſſibly able to ſuffer in this life, is meerly nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that which any one of all our ſins, hath deſerved. Will you perhaps conceive, that he deſerves not to be diſhonored, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, who hath diſhonored, and deſpiſed God? do you not think it to be reaſon, that he be lightly eſteemed, who ſet light by God? Will you not confeſs, that that will, which durſt offend the Creator of the world, ſhould never from thence forward, do any one thing which it pretends, or deſires, in puniſhment of ſo vaſt a preſumption.</p>
               <p>It ſerves alſo for a ſpur towards good works, and to keep a man from being negligent; and to make him walk on with fear and <hi>humilitie,</hi> in the ſight of God; begging pardon and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of him, as we are adviſed to do by the wiſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170072:29"/>man. <hi>Bleſſed is that man, who always fears.</hi> And be not without fear, even concerning thoſe ſins, of which you have repented. This conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our ſins, is a very efficatious means to make us put little value upon our ſelves, and to be ever humble, and to live, as it were, even under ground; for there is much to be gotten and digged up from thence.]</p>
               <p>If beſides we would ſtay, and conſider the defects and wounds, which original ſin hath cauſed in us, how copious would that matter be which we might find therein, for our humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation? How is our nature perverted and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by ſin! For as a ſtone is inclined by the natural weight thereof, to fal downward; juſt ſo, by the corruption of original ſin, we have a moſt active inclination to love honor, and profit, and ſatisfaction of our ſence; and we are extreamly awake towards all thoſe temporal things, which concern us; but ſtark dead, towards thoſe others, which are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and divine. That, commands in us, which in al reaſon, were to obey; and that obeys, which ſhould command. And to conclude, under the out-ſide, and poſture of men the appetites of beaſts ly concealed; and we have hearts which grow groveling towards the ground; the heart of man is wicked, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable, and who can arrive to the malice thereof? The deeper you dig into this wel, the greater abominations will you diſcover
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170072:29"/>therein, as was ſhewed in that figure to <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if now we wil apply our ſelves, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our preſent defects, we ſhal find our ſelves very full of them; for theſe grow ever out of our own ſtore. How ſlippery are our tongues, and how il guarded are our hearts? How inconſtant are we in our good purpoſes, and how earneſt for our own intereſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents?

St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith very wel, upon thoſe words of <hi>Job. Wilt thou break a leaf driven too and fro? Job</hi> 13.25. that a man is, with much reaſon, compared to the leaf of a tree.

For if we will conſider, and examine them wel, we ſhall find occaſion and matter enough, for which to humble our ſelves, by reaſon of the faults and imperfections, which commonly we mingle with them; according to that of the ſame <hi>Prophet; We are becom as one unclean, and all our juſtice is like ſom filthy and polluted rag.</hi> But of this we have ſpoken els where, and ſo there wil be no need to inlarge our ſelves now herein.</p>

               <p>OUr miſery is ſo great, and we have ſo much reaſon to humble our ſelves, and we have ſo hourly experience thereof: that we ſeem to ſtand in more need of being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and incouraged, to the end that we be not dejected and diſmayed, conſidering our ſelves to be ſo ful of imperfections and faults,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170072:30"/>then to be exhorted to the conſideration thereof. And this is ſo very true, that holy writers, and inſtructors of men in the way of holines, teach us; that we muſt dig, and ſound into the knowledg of our miſeries, and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in ſuch ſort, as we ſtop not there, for fear leſt the ſoul ſhould ſink down by diſtruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſpair, in regard we ſee ſo great miſery in our ſelves, and ſo great inconſtancy in our good purpoſes, but that we muſt then paſſe on, towards the knowledg of the goodnes of God, and place our whole confidence in him: that ſo the ſorrow of having ſinned, may not, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, be ſo great, as to cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and deſpair, leſt perhaps <hi>ſuch a one ſhould be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.7. But it is to be a well tempered ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and mingled with the hope of pardon caſting our eyes upon the mercy of God in, Chriſt Jeſus, and not fixing them wholly upon the only conſideration of our ſins, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and grievouſnes thereof; and ſo they ſay, that we muſt not dwell upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our own poverty, and weakneſs, leſt ſo we be diſmayed, but onely that we may thereby find reaſon to diſtruſt our ſelves, obſerving that on our part, we have no lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place on which to reſt, and then inſtantly to look up to God, and truſt in him, and thus we ſhall not only not remain diſcouraged, but we ſhal rather be animated, &amp; revived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, becauſe that which ſerves to make us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170072:31"/>when we behold our ſelves, will ſerve to ſtrengthen our hope when we look up to God: and the more we know our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the more we be diſtruſtfull of our ſelves by looking up to God, and relying on him, and by placing all our confidence in him we ſhall find our ſelves the more ſtrong, and full of courage in all things.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Fathers</hi> do here advertiſe us of a point which imports very much, namely, that as we muſt not dwel upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our infirmities, and miſeries, leſt we fall upon diſtruſt, and diſpair, but paſs on to the knowledge of the goodnes, the mercy, and liberality of God in Chriſt, and place our whole confidence in him: ſo alſo muſt we dwell as little here, but turn our eyes quickly in again upon our ſelves, and upon our own miſeries, and frailties. For if we ſtick upon the knowledge of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the mercy, and liberality of God, and forget what we are in our ſelves, we ſhall run much hazard of preſumption, and pride, and we ſhall grow to be too ſecure of our ſelves, and to be over-bold, and not ſo humble, and carefull as were fit, which is a dangerous courſe, and hath been the foundation, and root of many fearfull, and great ruins, O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, who were very ſpiritual, and who ſeemed to be exalted, as high as Heaven in the exerciſe of prayer, and contemplation, have caſt themſelves down headlong by this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170072:31"/>precipice? O how many who ſeemed to be Saints, have come by this means, to have moſt wretched fals? Becauſe they forgot themſelves; becauſe they made themſelves too ſure, through the favours which they had received from God? They grew to be ful of confidence, as if there had already been no more danger for them, and ſo they came miſerably to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>We have books which are ful of ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, that the cauſe of that miſerable fal of <hi>King David,</hi> both into adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and murther, was the preſumption which once he had, when he was viſited by the hand of God, with abundance of conſolation, ſo far as that he preſumed to ſay, <hi>I ſhall never be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or altered from this ſtate: Pſal:</hi> 30. Wel, ſtay a while, God will a little take off his hand: theſe extraordinary favours, and graces ſhall ceaſe, and you ſhall ſee what will happen. <hi>Thou turned away thy face from me, and I was troubled.</hi> God leaves you in your poverty, &amp; then you wil be like your ſelf; &amp; you ſhal know to your coſt, whou you are once fallen, that which you would not know whilſt you were viſited, and favoured by Almighty God: And Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> alſo ſaith, that the cauſe of the fal, and denial of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> was the confiding, and preſuming vainly in himſelf. Becauſe he ſaid with arrogancy, and preſumption, <hi>that though all men ſhould be ſcandalized yet would not he be ſcandalized, but would rather dye with Chriſt;</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:170072:32"/>For this did God permit, that he, ſhould fall; that ſo he might be humbled, and know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. We muſt never give way that our eyes may wander from our ſelves, nor ever be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in this life: but conſidering what we are, we muſt go ever on, with great care of our ſelves, and with great care, and fear, leſt the enemy whom we carry ſtill about us, put ſome trick upon us, and provide ſome ſnare, into which he may procure us to fall.</p>
               <p>So that as we muſt not ſtay upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our own miſery, and weaknes, but paſſe inſtantly on to the knowledge of the goodnes of God, ſo neither muſt we ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the knowledge of God, and his mercies, and favours, but return with ſpeed again, to caſt our eyes down upon our ſelves. This is that <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, whereof one end is faſtened to the earth, in our knowledg of our ſelves, and the other reaches up to the very height of Heaven. By this ladder muſt you aſcend, and deſcend, as the Angels aſcended, and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by that other. Riſe up by the knowledge of the goodnes of God, but ſtay not there, leſt you grow into preſumption, but deſcend to the knowledge of your ſelves: yet ſtay not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there, leſt you fall into deſpair; but ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to the knowledge of God, that ſo you may have confidence in him.

And I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo many defects, and have never la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented them, no nor even conſidered them as they deſerved. With this the devil not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to endure ſo great <hi>Humility</hi> on the one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170072:33"/>ſide, nor ſo great confidence in the other, (as we may imagine) ſaid thus to her. Be thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, and he alſo who hath taught thee this, for I know not how to make enterance here, ſince if I abaſe thee by confuſion, thou raiſeſt thy ſelf up as high as Heaven, by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the mercy of God: and if I raiſe thee up towards preſumption, thou abaſeſt thy ſelf by the conſideration of thy ſins, as low as hel by way of <hi>Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now after this very manner, are we to uſe this exerciſe, and ſo ſhall we on the one ſide, be full of circumſpection, and fear, and on the other, ful of courage, and joy. Fearful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our ſelves, and joyfull through our hope in God.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170072:33"/>of our ſelves, we will go on declaring ſome great benefits, and advantages which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined therein. One of the cheif thereof, hath been ſhewed already, namely, that this is the foundation, and root of <hi>Humility,</hi> and the neceſſary means both for the purchaſe, and preſervation thereof One of thoſe anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers being asked how a man might do to obtain true <hi>humility,</hi> made this anſwer. If he conſider only his own ſins, ſounding, &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging deep into the knowledge of himſelf, this man ſhall obtain true humility. This alone were ſufficient to make us attend much to this exerciſe, ſince it imports us ſo very much towards the obtaining of this vertue. But yet we may paſs further on, and ſay, that the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knowledge of our ſelves, is a more certain way towards the knowledge of God, then the profound ſtudy of all ſciences. And the reaſon which Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> gives is, that this is the moſt high ſcience of all others, and of the greateſt benefit. For from hence a man comes to the knowledge of God, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to be underſtood, as <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſaith, by the miſtery of that in the holy Goſpel which Chriſt our <hi>Saviour</hi> wrought, upon the perſon of the man who was born blind. For by laying duſt upon his eyes, he gave him both corporal ſight wherewith to ſee himſelf, and ſpiritual ſight alſo, wherewith to know, and adore God. So to us who are born blind through the ignorance both of God, and of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170072:34"/>our ſelves, God giveth ſight by laying durt upon our eyes where of we were made, to the end, that conſidering our ſelves who are but as a little durt, we may receive that ſight whereby firſt we may ſee, and know our ſelves, and from thence may arrive to know God. And the more any man knows his own baſenes, he ſhall the more diſcern the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and majeſty of God. For one contrary, and one extream put by the other, wil make that other appear the more. White layed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on black, appears the more freſh and clear. And ſo ſince man is the moſt extreame baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and God the moſt high excellency, they are two contrary extremes; and from hence it is, that the more a man knows himſelf, in whom he finds, that there is no goodnes at al, but onely nothing, and ſin; the more he finds the goodnes, and mercy, &amp; liberality of God, who vouchſafes to love us, and as it were, to converſe with ſo great a baſenes as ours is.</p>
               <p>From hence grows the ſoul to be greatly kindled, and inflamed towards the love of God, for it never gives over marvelling, and giving thanks to God, for that man being ſo miſerable, and ſo wicked, God indures him upon the earth, and daily alſo doth him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favours. For it happens often, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as endure our ſelves, and that yet the goodnes, and mercy of God towards us is ſuch, as that not onely he endures us,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170072:34"/>but he is pleaſed to ſay of us: <hi>My delight is to be with the Sons of men.</hi> What didſt thou find O Lord in the ſons of men, that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſay, my delights are to converſe with them.</p>
               <p>For this did the Saints ſo much frequent the exerciſe of the knowledge of themſelves, that ſo they might acquire a greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and a greater love to his divine Majeſty. This was that exerciſe, and prayer, which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> uſed. <hi>O my God, which art ever the ſame, and never changeſt; let me know my ſelf, and let me know thee.</hi> And this was the prayer of another, wherein he ſpent whole dayes, and nights; <hi>Who art thou O Lord, and who am I.</hi> By this way came the Saints to a very high knowledge of God, and this is a very plain and certain way: and the more you dig down into the knowledge of your ſelves, the higher ſhall you riſe, and the more ſhall you grow in the knowledge of God, and of his infinite mercy, and goodnes. As alſo on the other ſide, the higher you riſe, and the more you grow in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, the lower you will deſcend, and the more you will profit in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your ſelves. For the light which comes to you from Heaven, will ſhew you ſuch ſluttiſh corners in your ſouls, as will make you aſhamed of that which, in the eyes of the world, will ſeem very fair, and good. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſaith, that as when the ſun
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170072:35"/>beams enter into any room, every moat of the air will ſhew it ſelf. So the ſoul being il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by the knowledge of God, and by the beams of that true ſun of juſtice, the very leaſt things will inſtantly be ſeen, and ſo the ſoul comes to hold that for faulty, which he who enjoyes not ſo great light, will eſteem to be good.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon why all holy men are ſo humble, and hold themſelves in ſo ſmal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and the more holy, and perfect they are, they are the more humble, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count wherein they hold themſelves, is ſo much the leſſe. For ſtill, as they have more light, and greater knowledge of God, they know themſelves better, and ſee that of their own ſtock, they cannot brag, but onely of nothing, and of ſin. And how much ſoever they know themſelves, and how many faults ſoever they ſee in their own ſouls, they ſtil beleeve, that there are many more which they ſee not, and conceive that the leaſt part thereof, is that which they can come to know, and after this rate do they eſteem themſelves. For as they beleeve that God is more good then they are able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſo alſo do they beleeve, that themſelves are more wicked then they can underſtand. And as, how much ſoever we conceive, or know of God, we cannot perfectly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, but ſtill there will be more, and much more to be conceived, and known; ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170072:35"/>how much ſoever we know our ſelves, and how much ſoever we humble, and deſpiſe our ſelves, we ſhall never be able to deſcend ſo low, as to arrive to the depth of our miſery. And this is no aggraration, but a clear truth. For ſince man hath nothing of his own ſtore, but nothing, and ſin, who will ever be able to humble and abaſe himſelf ſo much, as thoſe two titles deſerve.</p>
               <p>We read of a devout Woman who deſired light of God to know her ſelf, and ſhe diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo much deformity, and miſery in her condition, that ſhe was not able to endure it, and then ſhe prayed thus to God. <hi>O Lord not ſo much, for I ſhall faint under the hurden.</hi> And of another, who begged of God many times that he would make him ſee, and know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, God opened his eyes a little, and it had like to have coſt him dear. For he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo ugly, and ſo abominable, that he utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red loud cries, and ſaid: <hi>O Lord I beſeech thee, even for thy mercies ſake, to take this ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle from before mine eyes, for I can look no longer upon this figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence grows alſo, that holy kind of hate, and deteſtation of themſelves, in the ſervants of God, whereof I ſpake before. For how much more they know the immenſe goodnes of God; and love him more, ſo much the more do they abhor themſelves, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been oppoſites, and enemies of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Joh. Why haſt thou ſet me as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170072:36"/>a mark againſt thee, ſo that I am a burden to my ſelf. Job:</hi> 7.20. They ſee that in themſelves they have the root of all miſchief, which is the wicked, and perverſe inclination of our fleſh, and upon this knowledge, they raiſe themſelves up againſt themſelves, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor themſelves. Do you not think it reaſon to abhor him, who made you forſake, and ſell ſo great a good as God is, for a little vain contentment, or carnal delight? Do you not think it reaſon for you to hate him, who made you looſe eternal glory, and deſerve Hell for even, him who wrought you ſo much hurt, and ſtill perſiſts in doing it, do you not think that you have cauſe to deteſt? Well now, this perſon is your ſelf, an oppoſite, and enemy of God, an oppoſite and enemy of your own ſalvation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> That the knowledge of ones ſelf, doth not canſe diſmay, but rather gives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and ſtrength.</head>
               <p>THere is another great benefit, which grows from the exerciſe of knowing a mans ſelf; that not onely it cauſes no diſmay, or baſe fear, as perhaps ſome might doubt, but rather a great heart, and courage, towards all thoſe things which are good. And the reaſon
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170072:36"/>of this is, that when a man knows himſelf, he ſees that here is no colour why he ſhould rely upon himſelf, but that diſtruſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he muſt put all his confidence in God, in whom he finds himſelf ſtrong, and able for all things. Hence it is, that theſe are the men who are apt to attempt, and undertake great things, and theſe are they who go through with them. For in regard they aſcribe all to God, and nothing to themſelves, God takes the buſines in hand, and makes it his, and holds it upon his own account; and then he is wont to do mighty things, and even wonders, by the means of weak inſtruments. To ſhew the riches, and treaſures of his mercies, God will do wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, by inſtruments who are miſerable and weak. He uſes to put the treaſures of his mercy into the pooreſt veſſels, for thus doth his glory ſhine moſt. This is that which God ſaid to St: <hi>Paul,</hi> when being even tired with temptations, he cryed out, and begged, that he might be delivered from them; and God made him this anſwer. <hi>My grace ſhall be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee,</hi> how great ſoever thy temptations and miſeries may be, and then doth the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God prove it ſelf to be more ſtrong, and perfect, when the weaknes, and infirmity is more apparent. For as the Phyſitian gains more honour, when the ſicknes which he cures is more dangerous, ſo when there is more weaknes in us, our delivery brings
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170072:37"/>more glory to Gods arm, and power; and ſo doth Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this place. So that when a man knows and diſtruſts himſelf, and puts all his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, then doth his Majeſty come and help; and when on the other ſide, a man puts conſidence in himſelf, and in his own diligences, and means, he is forſaken by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. This ſaith Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> is the cauſe why when we deſire to make our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers beſt, and to have moſt devotion in certain principal times, and occaſions, it ſals out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, that we have leſſe; becauſe we put our conſidence in our own means, and in our own diligences, and preparations. And at other times, we are prevented with great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions, and ſweetnes, when we look for them leaſt, to the end, that we may know, that this is an effect of the grace, and mercy of our <hi>Lord,</hi> and of no diligence, or merit of ours. So that a mans knowing his miſery, and frailty, cauſes no cowardiſe, or diſmay, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives courage, and ſtrength, in regard that it makes him diſtruſt himſelf, and place all his confidence in God. And this is alſo that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When I am weak then am I ſtrong.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.10. That is, <hi>when</hi> I <hi>am humbled, then I am exalted.</hi> For thus do hoth Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. When I humble and abaſe my ſelf, and know that I am good for nothing, then am I exalted and raiſed up. Whilſt I know,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170072:37"/>and ſee my infirmity, and miſery, faſtning my ſelf upon God, I find my ſelf more ſtrong, and more ful of courage, for he is all my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Hereby you may underſtand, that it is not <hi>Humility,</hi> nor any thing which ſprings from thence, when there com to us ſomtimes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſmays, and dejections, concerning our little progreſs in grace, and when we fear that we ſhal never obtain ſuch or ſuch a virtue, and never overcom ſuch an il condition or inclination; or that we ſhal not be fit for this or that office, and miniſtery in which we are or may be imployed. This may ſeem to be <hi>humility,</hi> but many times it is not ſo, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſprings from pride. For ſuch a one caſts his eyes upon himſelf, as if by his own ſtrength, and diligences, he were to go through with that buſineſs; wheras he ought to caſt them upon God, in whom we are to be ful of confidence and courage; and ſay, <hi>The Lord is my light, and my ſalvation, whom then ſhal I fear; the Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom then ſhal I be afraid. If whole armies ſhal riſe againſt me, my heart ſhal nor be afraid. If they ſhal bid me battel yet wil I hope in God.</hi> Pſal. 27. <hi>Though I walk in the midſt of the very ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, and arrive even at the very gates of hel, yet my heart ſhal not fear, becauſe thou O Lord art with me.</hi> Pſal. 23. With what varietie of words, doth the holy Prophet expreſs the ſelf ſame thing, and indeed we have the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170072:38"/>Pſalms ful of this, to ſignifie the abundance of pious affections, and of the confidence which he had, and which we ought to have in God. <hi>In my God, I wil paſs over a wal,</hi> how high ſoever it may be. Nothing ſhal be able to put it ſelf between me, and home. God can conquer giants, by graſhoppers. <hi>In my God, I wil tread lions and dragons under my feet.</hi> By the grace and favour of our Lord, we ſhal be ſtrong.

                  <hi>CHAP: XI.</hi> Of other great benefits and advantages, which grow, by the exerciſe of a mens knowledge of himſelf.</head>
               <p>ONe of the principal means, which, for our parts, we are able to imploy, to the end that our <hi>Lord</hi> may ſhew us favour, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate great graces and gifts to us is, that we humble our ſelves, and know our own frailty and miſery. And ſo ſaid the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul, I wil gladly glory in my infirmities, and weakneſſes,</hi> that ſo the power of Chriſt may dwel in me. And St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon thoſe words, <hi>I am pleaſed in my infirmities,</hi> ſaith, <hi>If a Chriſtian be to glory, it is to be in his own pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and miſerie, whereby he may increaſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, in the ſight of God,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> brings
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170072:38"/>that of the Prophet, to this purpoſe. <hi>Thou O God, ſenteſt a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreſhedſt it when it was weary.</hi> When, think you, that God will give the voluntary and ſweet rain of his gifts, and graces to his inheritance, which is the ſoul of man? When the ſame ſoul ſhal underſtand her own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and miſery, then wil he perfect it, and the voluntary and ſweet ſhower of his gifts and graces, ſhal fal down upon it. And as here amongſt us, the more our poor beggars diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their wretchednes, and their ſores, to rich and charitable men, the more they move them to pity, and the more aims they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at their hands, ſo the more a man knows, and humbles himſelf, and confeſſes his miſery, the more doth he invite, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the mercy of God, to take pitty, and compaſſion on him, and to communicate the gifts of his grace with the more abundance. For he gives ſtrength to the weak, and to to them who are, as if they were not, but he multiplies courage, and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>To declare in few words, the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and advantages of this exerciſe, I ſay that the true knowledge of a mans ſelf, is the univerſal remedy of all inconveniences. And ſo in the queſtions which we uſe to ask in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual conferences, whence ſuch or ſuch a thing uſes to grow, &amp; what may be the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thereof, we may in effect anſwer in them all, that they proceed from want of a mans
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170072:39"/>knowing himſelf, and that the remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would be to know, and humble himſelf as he ought. For if you aſk whence it grows that I judge of my Brethren, I ſay from the want of knowing my ſelf. For if I would diligently watch over my ſelf, and duly examine mine own heart, I ſhould find ſo much for me to do, and ſo many miſeries to bewail, that I would not mark the faults of others. If you aſk from whence it comes, that ſometimes I ſpeak ſharp, and unmortified words to my Brethren, that alſo grows from the want of knowing my ſelf. For if I knew my ſelf well, and held my ſelf for the worſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and looked upon every other man as if he were my ſuperior, I ſhould not be ſo bold, as to uſe ſuch language to them. If you aſk from whence grow thoſe excuſes, and thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and thoſe murmurings, as why they do not give me this or that, or why they treat me in ſuch a faſhion; it is cleer that it riſes from the ſame root. If you aſk from whence it comes, that a man is ſo much troubled, and dejected, when he finds himſelf moleſted, by variety of temptations, or grows melancholy, and is diſcouraged, when he fals often into any defect; this alſo grows from want of a mans knowing himſelf. For if you were truly humble, &amp; conſidered wel the malice of your hearts, you would not be troubled, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid at this, but you would rather be in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that you commit no worſe things, how
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170072:39"/>you came not to have more dangerous faults and you would be giving great thanks, and praiſ to God, for holding you ſo faſt in his hand, that ſo you fall not into thoſe things, into which infallibly you would have fallen, if he had nor held you up. For from a very ſource, and ſink of vice, what ſin is that which would not flow? From ſuch a filthy dunghill what ſhould we expect, but an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abominable ſtink, and from ſuch a tree, ſuch fruit, upon thoſe words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>He remembreth that we are but duſt,</hi> Saint <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſaith, what wonder is it, if duſt be blown away by wind. If alſo you deſire a means whereby you may come to ſhew much charity towards your Brethren, and that you may be obedient, and patient, and very penitent, you may here find the remedy of all.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> How much it concerneth us to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the knowledge of our ſelves.</head>
               <p>IT will appear by what is ſaid, how much it concerns us to be exerciſed in the knowledge of our ſelves. <hi>Thales Male ſius,</hi> one of the ſeven wiſe men of <hi>Greece,</hi> being aſked which of all natural things, was the hardeſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170072:40"/>to be known, made this anſwer, <hi>A mans ſelf.</hi> Becauſe the love which a man bears himſelf, is ſo great, that it diſtracts, and hinders this knowledge, and from hence grew that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was ſo much celebrated amongſt the antients. <hi>Noſce te ipſum,</hi> know thy ſelf. And another ſaid, <hi>Tecum habita,</hi> dwell with thy ſelf. But let us leave theſe ſtrangers, and come home to others of our own communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who are bettter maſters of this ſcience. The bleſſed Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſay, that the ſcience of a mans knowing himſelf, is the moſt profitable, and moſt high that ever was invented, or found. Men, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> are wont to eſteem much the knowledge of the Heavens, and of the earth by Aſtrology, and Coſmography, and to know the motions of the ſkie, and the courſe of the planets. With their proprieties, and influences; but yet the knowledge of a mans ſelf, is the moſt high and profitable ſcience of them all. Other ſciences blow a man, and puffe him up, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; but we are humbled, and edified by this. And ſo the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, end all ſpiritual conductors, do greatly charge us, to imploy our ſelves in prayer, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this exerciſe: and they reprove the error of ſome, who paſſe too lightly over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their own delects; and detain themſelves in thinking upon other devout things, becauſe they find conſolation in them, but none in the conſideration of their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170072:40"/>defects, and faults, becauſe they take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in looking into themſelves; and in this they are like ſuch as are deformed, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo, dare not look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a glaſſe.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaking to Man, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God, ſaith thus. O man, if thou didſt ſee and know thy ſelf, thou wouldeſt be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to thy ſelf, and thou wouldeſt be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me: but now becauſe thou doeſt not ſee, and know thy ſelf, thou art pleaſing to thy ſelf, and art diſpleaſing to me. Take heed that there come not once a time, when thou ſhalt neither be pleaſing to God, nor to thy ſelf; not to God, becauſe thou haſt ſinned; nor to thy ſelf, becauſe thou art damned by thy ſelf, through thine own fault.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> treating of this, ſaith, there are ſome, who as ſoon as they begin to ſerve God, and to take vertue a little into their conſideration, think preſently, that they are holy, and good; and do ſo place their eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good they do, that they forget their miſeries, and ſins paſt, yea and ſometimes, their preſent ſins too; for they are ſo very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie about gazing upon the good they do, that they attend not, nay and ſee not, the il which ſometimes they commit. But ſuch as indeed are good, and the elect of God, proceed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a very different manner. For whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are full of vertue, and good works, they are yet ever looking upon the ill they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170072:41"/>do, and are conſidering, and ruminating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their in perfections, and defects And we ſhall quickly ſee what become of both theſe kinds of men. For they who are moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their ſins, ſecure their good deeds, and conſerve the great vertues which they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, remaining ever in <hi>Humility;</hi> and on the contrary ſide, thoſe others, who are looking ſo earneſtly upon their good deeds, looſe them, becauſe they grow vain, and proud thereof. So that good men ſerve themſelves of their very ſins, and draw good, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual profit from thence, whereas ill men draw hurt, and loſſe, even from their good deeds, becauſe they make ill uſe thereof. As it happens in the caſe of corporal food, which though in it ſelf it be healthfull and good, yet if a man eat of it without rule or meaſure, it will make him ſick. And ſo on the other ſide, if the very poiſon of vipers be taken, with a certain compoſition, and proportion, it will become a treacle, and give him health. When therefore they ſhall bring the good things which you have done to your memory, to the end, that you may eſteem, and value your ſelf. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> adviſes you, to oppoſe your ill deeds againſt them, and to call your former ſins to mind. So did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to the end, that his great virtues might not blow him up, as alſo his having been rapt into the third Heaven, and made capable of thoſe high revelations, which were imparted
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170072:41"/>to him. <hi>Alas ſaith he, I have been a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor of the ſervants of God, and of the name of Chriſt; alas I am not worthy to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I have perſecuted the Church of God.</hi> This is a very good counterpoiſe, and a very good countermine, againſt this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Upon thoſe words, which the Archangel <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſpake to the prophet <hi>Daniel, O ſon of man obſerve, what I intend to ſay to thee. S. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> ſaith, that thoſe holy prophets, <hi>Daniel, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Zacharias,</hi> through the high and continual revelations, which they had, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already, as it were, to converſe amongſt the Quires of Angels; and to the end that they might not exalt themſelves above themſelves, and grow idle headed, &amp; proud, upon that occaſion, as conceiving that they were grown to be of a kind of Superior and Angelical nature, the Angel lets them know on the part of God, that they muſt remember their humane nature and frailty; and he cals them ſons of men, that ſo they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand themſelves to be frail men, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures like the reſt; and that ſo they might be humble, and eſteem themſelves but as they were. And we have many examples in hiſtories both eccleſiaſtical and prophane, both of Saints and other illuſtrious perſons, Kings Emperors, and Prelates, who uſed this means, and ever kept ſom about them, who might bring them to remembrance from
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170072:42"/>time to time, that they were but men; ſo to conſerve them in <hi>humilitie,</hi> and to keep them from growing vain and proud.</p>
               <p>It is recounted of <hi>Franciſcui Borgia,</hi> that whilſt he was yet Duke of Gandia, an holy man gave him this counſel, that if he had a mind to profit much in the ſervice of God, no day might paſs, wherein he would not think ſeriouſly of ſomwhat, which might put him to confuſion, and a mean opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And he took this counſel ſo much to heart, that from the time that he uſed the exerciſe of mental prayer, he imployed every day, the two firſt hours thereof, upon this knowledge, and contempt of himſelf. And beſides, whatſoever he heard, and read, and ſaw, it all ſerved him towards this abaſing, and confuſion. Let us therefore obſerve this counſel, and practiſe it. Let no one day paſs, wherein we ſpend not ſom time of prayer, and conſider not ſomwhat which may tend to our confuſion and contempt: and let us not grow weary, nor give over this exerciſe, til we find that our ſoul hath even drunk up, a profound and cordial deſire to be diſeſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed: and til we may feel our ſelves to be greatly aſhamed, to appear with ſo much baſeneſs and miſery as ours is, before the high preſence and majeſty of almighty God.</p>
               <p>We have very much need of all this, for our pride, and inclination to be honored,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170072:42"/>and eſteemed, is ſo great, that if we walk not continually in this exerciſe, we ſhall find our ſelves every hour to be liſted up above our ſelves, as cork ſwimming upon the water, for no cork is ſo light and vain as we. We muſt ever be repreſſing, and beating down that ſwelling and pride which heaves us up, and we muſt look towards the feet of our defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and baſenes, that ſo the wheel of our vanity, and pride may be broken in peeces. Let us remember the parable of the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, which is mentioned in the holy Goſpel, and which the owner thereof hath a mind to pluck up by the roots; becauſe in three years it had born no fruit; but the gardener moved that it might be ſuffered to grow a year lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſaid that he would dig about it, and that if then, it gave no fruit, it might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be rooted up. Dig you in like manner, about the dry, and barrain Fig-tree of your ſouls, and let the dung, and miſeries of your ſins be caſt round about it, ſince you have ſuch ſtore thereof, and ſo you ſhall be alſo fertile, and bear fruit.</p>
               <p>To the end, that we may be the more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to uſe this exerciſe, and that no man take occaſion to give it over through any vain apprehenſions. We are to underſtand two things. The firſt, that no man muſt think this exerciſe belongs onely to beginners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it alſo concerns Proficients, and moſt perfect men; ſince we ſee that they, and even
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170072:43"/>St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf did uſe it. In the ſecond place it is fit for us to underſtand, that this exerciſe is no afflictive, or melancholy kind of thing, nor cauſes trouble or diſquiet, but rather brings with it great peace, and reſt, yea, and great contentment, and joy, for any man to conſider, and know himſelf, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny defects or faults ſoever he commit, and how perfectly ſoever he underſtand; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſo wicked, he deſerves that al men ſhould deſpiſe, and hate him. For when this knowledge of our ſelves grows from true <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> that pain comes accompanied with ſuch a kind of ſwavity, and contentment, that a man would be ſorry to be without it. Other pains and troubles which ſome feel, when they conſider their faults and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, are temptations of the divel, who on the one ſide, procures by this means, to make us think that we are truly humble; and on the other, would be content to make us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt the goodnes of God, and to be diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and diſmayed in his ſervice. Indeed if we were ſtill to pauſe upon the knowledge of our own miſery, and weaknes, we ſhould have occaſion enough to be afflicted and ſad, yea and to be diſcouraged, and diſmayed, but we muſt not ſtay there, but paſſe on to the conſideration of the goodnes, and mercy, and liberality of God, and how much he loves us, and what he ſuffered for us, and in this are we to place all our hope. And ſo, that which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170072:43"/>would be an occaſion of diſmay, and ſorrow, by looking upon our ſelves, ſerves to animate and incourage us, and is an occaſion of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er comfort and joy, when we lift up our eyes towards God. A man beholds himſelf, and ſees nothing but cauſe of grief, but looking up to God, he confides in his goodnes without fear of being forſaken, notwithſtanding the many faults, and imperfections, and miſeries which he diſcerns in himſelf. For the goodnes and mercy of God, upon which he hath placed his eyes, and his heart, doth infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and out ſtrip al that which can be ill in us. And with this conſideration, being root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the very ſtrings of the heart, a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties himſelf from himſelf, as from ſome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reed, and ever goes reſting upon God, and confiding in him, according to that of the Prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi> Not confiding in our ſelves, nor in any merit, or good work of ours, do we preſume to lift up our eyes to thee O Lord, and to beg favour at thy hands but by putting our confidence in thy great mercy.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,</hi> is when a man deſires to be held by others in ſmal account. Deſires to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and diſ-eſteemed, and that no body may have you in account. If we were well grounded in the firſt degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> we ſhould already have made moſt of our way towards the ſecond. If really we eſteemed our ſelves little, it would not ſeem very hard to us, that others ſhould alſo eſteem little of us; yea and we would be glad thereof. Wil you ſee that this is true, ſaith he? All men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally glad, when others conform themſelves to our opinion, and think the fame that we think. Well then, if this be ſo, why are we not glad, when others have us in ſmal account? Do you not know why? Becauſe we eſteem highly of our ſelves, and we are not of their opinion. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> upon theſe words of <hi>Job,</hi> (as they are read according to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar latine: <hi>I have ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170072:44"/>and that, but they beleeve not what they ſay, for when others ſay the ſame, yea, an leſſe then that, they cannot indure it. And theſe men when they ſpeak ill of themſelves, ſay it nor with truth, nor do they feel it ſo in their hearts, as <hi>Job</hi> did when he ſaid: I have ſinned, and really tranſgreſſed, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, and he hath not puniſhed me, according to my great demerit. <hi>Job</hi> ſaid this with truth of heart, but theſe men ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> do humble themſelves only in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and with the tongue. Whereas in their heart they have no <hi>Humility.</hi> They will needs ſeem to be humble, whereas they have no mind to be ſo indeed: for if in earneſt they deſired it, they would not be offended ſo much, when they were reprehended, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of any fault by others, and they would not excuſe themſelves, nor be troubled ſo much as we ſee they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſſianus</hi> recounts, that a certain religious man came once to viſit the devout <hi>Father Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapion,</hi> who in habit, jeſture, and words, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of great <hi>humility,</hi> and contempt of himſelf, and never made an end of ſpeaking ill of himſelf, and of ſaying that he was ſo great a ſinner, and ſo wicked a man, that he was not worthy to breath in the common air, nor to tread upon the earth, and much leſſe would he conſent that they ſhould waſh his feet, or do him any ſervice. Wiſe <hi>Serapion,</hi> after he had dined, began to treat of ſome
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170072:45"/>ſpiritual things, as he had been accuſtomed, and applied alſo ſome little thing to his gueſt, and gave him this good advice with great mildnes and love; Namely, that fince he was young and ſtrong, he ſhould be careful to keep at home, and labour with his hands for his food, according to the rule of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and not to go idly up and and down to the houſes of others. The young man was ſo much troubled at this admonition, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, that he could not poſſibly diſſemble it, but ſhewed it evidently by his countenance, Then ſaid <hi>Serapion,</hi> what is this my ſon, that till now you have been ſpeaking ſo much ill of your ſelf, and ſo many things of diſhon our and affront to you; and that now, upon an admonition, ſo eaſie as this which contains no injury, or affront at all, but rather much love, and charity, you have been ſo much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and altered, that you could not hide it? Did you hope perhaps, by means of that ill which you ſaid of your ſelf, to hear that ſentence of the wiſeman out of my mouth. This man is juſt and humble, ſince he ſpeaks ill of himſelf? Did you pretend that we ſhould praiſe you, and hold you for a Saint. Ah, ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> how many times is this that very thing, to which we pretend by our hypocriſies, and counterfeit <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</hi> but that which would fain ſeem <hi>humility</hi> is great pride. For we humble our ſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, to the end that we may be praiſed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170072:45"/>by men, &amp; beheld for humble and good. And if you will not grant me this, I muſt ask you why you ſay that of your ſelf, which you will not have others to beleeve? If you ſpeak it from your heart, and if you walk in the way of truth, you muſt deſire that others may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it too, and may hold you for ſuch as you ſaid; and if you deſire not this, you ſhew plainly that you pretend not thereby to be humbled, but to be valued and eſteemed. This is that, which the wiſeman ſaith: There are ſome who humble themſelves after a counterfeit manner, and their heart is full of deceit, and pride. For what greater deceit can there be, then by means of <hi>humility,</hi> to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, and eſteemed by men; and what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pride, then to pretend to be held hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? To pretend to the praiſe of <hi>humility,</hi> is not (ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) the vertue of <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> but the perverſion, and ſubverſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For what greater perverſion can there be then this? What thing can be more unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, then to deſire to ſeem to be the better for that, for which you ſeem worſe? What things more unworthy &amp; abſurd, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſeem good, and to be held for ſuch, even for the ill which you have ſaid of your ſelf, Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> reprehending this, ſaith thus. Many have the apparence of <hi>Humility,</hi> but yet they have not the vertue of <hi>humility,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeem exteriorly to ſeek it, but interiorly they contradict it.</p>

They ſeem indeed to humble themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly, becauſe they deſire men to tell them their faults, but this is no <hi>humility,</hi> but pride, for their deſigne thereby is to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. At other times you ſhal have a man ſpeak il of ſomewhat, which he hath done, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he is not pleaſed with it, that ſo he may come to know what the other thinks, and he would fain hear it excuſed, and that the other ſhould ſay, no certainly it was very well ſaid, or done; and you have no reaſon at all to be diſquieted with your ſelf, upon that occaſion. This I ſay, is that which he ſought. A certain grave <hi>Father,</hi> who was a very ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man, was wont to call this a pride, of by hook or by crook; becauſe by this deviſe, or engine, one man fetches praiſe out of the mouth of another. A man makes an end of his Sermon, and is very wel content, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with himſelf, and intreats another to tel him his faults: But to what end ſerve theſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170072:46"/>hypocriſies, and fictions: for you beleeve not that there were any faults, nor pretend any other thing, but that he ſhould praiſe your ſermon, and that he ſhould jump with your own opinion; and that is indeed the thing which you are glad to hear; For if by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he tell you plainly of any fault, you are not pleaſed, but rather you will defend it, and ſomtimes it happens, that you wil judge him who told you of it; as not having ſo good an underſtanding, and note in things of that nature, becauſe he held that for a fault, which you conceive to have been well ſaid. All this is pride, and deſire of praiſe, which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſatisfie, by this counterfeit <hi>Humility.</hi> At other times, when we are not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the fault, we confeſſe it very clearly, to the end, that ſince we have loſt a point? of honour by making the fault, we may recover it again by confeſſing it after an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner. At other times, ſaith <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> we exaggerate our own faults, and ſay more then is true, to the end, that others ſeeing that it is neither poſſible, nor credible, to have been ſo much as was ſaid, they may think that there was no fault committed at al, that ſo they may caſt the accuſation upon the account of our <hi>humility;</hi> So that by exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating, and declaring more then is true, we would conceal the fault which in truth is that which we intend. By a thouſand devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and tricks, do we procure to hide, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170072:47"/>diſguiſe our pride, under the cloak of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, by the way you ſhall ſee, as St: <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, how pretious a thing <hi>humility,</hi> and how baſe and hateful pride is. See how ſublime and glorious a thing <hi>humility</hi> is, ſince even pride deſires to ſerve it ſelf thereof, and to be cloaked therewith, and ſee alſo how baſe, and ſhameful a thing pride is, ſince it dares not ſo much as appear with the face diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; but overſhadowed, and diſguiſed by the veil of <hi>humility.</hi> For you would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly aſhamed, and hold your ſelves for greatly affronted, it the other ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that you pretend, and deſire to be eſteemed, and praiſed: and therefore it is, that you procure to cover your pride, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of <hi>humility.</hi> But now, why will you indeed be that, which you are ſo aſhamed to ſeem to be. If you would be ſo out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that others ſhould know you deſire to be eſteemed, and praiſed, why are you not much more aſhamed to deſire it. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ill thereof, conſiſts in the act it ſelf, of your deſiring it, and not in their knowing that you deſire it. And if you be aſhamed that men ſhould know it; why are you not aſhamed that it ſhould be ſeen, and known by Almighty God. Thine eies <hi>O Lord</hi> ſee how imperfect I am. All this come upon us, for not being wel rooted in the firſt degree of <hi>humility,</hi> which keeps us ſo far from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170072:47"/>We muſt undertake this buſines from, the firſt grounds thereof; for firſt it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us to underſtand our own miſery, and our nothing, and from this kind of profound knowledge of our ſelves, is to grow a baſe conceit in us, and a deſpiſing, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of what we are, which is the firſt degree of <hi>humility,</hi> and from thence we muſt get up to the ſecond. So that it ſuffices not that you ſpeak ill of your ſelf, yea even though you ſpeak it ſincerely, and from your heart, but you muſt procure to arrive ſo far, as that you may be glad, that others think that of you, which you think, and ſay of your ſelf; and that they diſeſteem, and deſpiſe you. Saint <hi>John Climacus</hi> ſaith, he is no humble man who is content to abaſe, and ſpeak ill of himſelf, (for what man is he, who cannot be content to bear with himſelf) but that man is humble, who can eaſily be glad to be ill intreated, and deſpiſed by others. It is well, that a man ſhould ever be ſpeaking ill of himſelf, and confeſſing that he is proud, and ſlothful, and impatient, and careleſs, &amp; the like; but it were better that he kept his patience, til he were told as much by others. If you deſire that others may think ſo of you, and hold you in no other eſtimation, or account then this, and that you are truly glad thereof, when the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is offered, this indeed is true <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of ſome degrees, and ſteps, whereby a man may riſe to the perfection of this ſecond degree of Humility.</head>
               <p>IN regard that this ſecond degree of <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is the moſt practical, and difficult part of the exerciſe of this vertue, we will divide it as ſome have done before us: and we will ſet forth four degrees, or ſteps thereof, that ſo by little and little, and as it were by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured paces, we may riſe up to that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>humility,</hi> which this ſecond degree ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts. The firſt ſtep is, not to deſire to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, nor eſteemed by men, but rather to fly from all that, which hath any touch of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and eſtimation. Our books are ful of the examples of Saints, who were ſo very far from deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing to be eſteemed or honored by the world, as that they fled from honors, and dignities, and from all thoſe occaſions which might bring eſtimation with them in the ſight of men, as from the moſt capitall enemy which they could have. Chriſt our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and our Maſter, gave us the firſt example of this, when he fled upon his notice, that they meant to choſe him for their King; after that illuſtrious miracle of having fed five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170072:48"/>men with five loaves, and two fiſhes; when yet himſelf ran no hazard in any ſtate of life, how high ſoever it might be, but only to give us example And for the ſelf ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when he was pleaſed to manifeſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his moſt ſacred body, to his three Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in his admirable transfiguration, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them not to ſpeak of it to any, til af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, and glorious reſurrection, and giving ſight to thoſe blind men, and working of other miracles, he commanded them to be ſilent. And al this was done to give us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of flying from honor, and the eſtimation of men, in regard of our great danger to grow vain, and ſo to periſh therby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gerſon</hi> brings that to this purpoſe, which the Poets ſain of the Giant <hi>Antheus</hi> ſon of the earth: Who fighting with <hi>Hercules,</hi> recovered new ſtrength, every time that he was caſt down to the ground, and ſo he could not be overcome; but <hi>Hercules</hi> obſerving this, lifted him up on high, and ſo cut off his head. This ſaith <hi>Gerſon,</hi> doth the devil pretend to do with us. He ſeeks to hoiſe us up with honor, eſtimation, and praiſe, that ſo he may cut our throats, and, then caſt us down more low, then we roſe high, And therefore the true humble man caſts himſelf down to the earth, in the knowledge of himſelf, and fears, and flies from being puffed up, and praiſed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree, as Saint <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſaith, is this, to ſuffer with patience, whenſoever
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170072:49"/>any occaſion is offered, whereby you may ſeem to be diſparaged, or deſpiſed, and to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies, and affronts; and that you ſhould go in ſearch thereof, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice therein, when you find them. That point is more high, and perfect, and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſhal treat thereof, but that which now we ſay is, that when any thing ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf, which may ſeem to point at your diſadvantage, you bear it at leaſt with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if you cannot do it with joy. According to that of the wiſeman. All that which offers itſelf, contrary to your ſenſuality, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, receive it in good part, though it trouble, you, and ſuffer it with <hi>humility,</hi> and patience. This is a great means, both for the obtaining of <hi>Humility,</hi> and preſerving it. For at honor, and the eſtimation of men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s a means to make us proud, and vain, and therefore did the Sts. fly ſo far from it, ſo all that which tends to our diſeſtimation, and contempt, is a very great means both for the getting of <hi>humility,</hi> and growing in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laurentius Juſtinianus</hi> was wont to ſay, that <hi>Humility</hi> is like a ſtream, or brook, which in winter carries much water, and little in ſummer, and ſo <hi>humility</hi> grows leſſe and leſſe in proſperity, and greater in adverſity.</p>
               <p>Many are the occaſions, and they are offered us daily, for the exerciſe of <hi>humility,</hi> if we would uſe attention, and care in profiting
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170072:49"/>thereby. As thus, that which pleaſes others ſhal be effected, that which contents thee ſhal not be done, that which others ſay ſhal be eſteemed, that which thou ſaiſt, ſhal ſtand for nothing. Others ſhal aſk, and receive, thou ſhalt beg, and ſhalt not obtain; others ſhal be great in the mouths of men, and ſhal make no account of thee: and affairs ſhal be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to others, and thou ſhalt be held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for them. Let every man take account of himſelf, and go diſcourſing of thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſions, which may or uſe to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and obſerve how he proceeds therein. Obſerve how you like it, when another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you reſolutely, and after an imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner. Obſerve how you take it, when they admoniſh you, or reprove you for any fault Obſerve what you think, when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that your ſuperior deals not confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but looks upon you with a kind of wary, or jealous eye. Saint <hi>Dorotheus</hi> adviſes, that whenſoever any of theſe occaſions is offered us, to receive it as a remedy, and medicine, wherewith to cure, and heale our pride; and to pray God for him who miniſters the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as for the Phiſitian of our ſouls, and to be fully perſwaded, that whoſoever abhors theſe things abhors <hi>humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third ſtep which we are to mount, is, that we rejoyce not, and take no c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when men do eſteem and praiſe us. This is more hard then the laſt ſtep, as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:170072:50"/>ſaith. Though it be an eaſie thing to want praiſe when it is not given; yet for a man to be glad to be eſteemed, and praiſed, and not to take contentment therein, when it is offered, is very hard. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles this point very wel, upon thoſe words of <hi>Job. If I ſaw the ſun when it ſhined, and when the moon went brightly on, and if my heart rejoyced in ſecret,</hi> he ſaith that <hi>Job</hi> ſpake thus, becauſe he did not joy, or take vain content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the praiſes, and eſtimation of men. For this is to behold the ſun when it ſhines, and the moon when it is bright, for a man to conſider the praiſe, opinion, and fame, which he hath amongſt men, and takes delight, and guſt therein. He ſaith therefore, that there is this difference between the humble, and the proud, that the proud rejoyce when they are praiſed, though it be not true, which is ſaid of them, and they rejoyce becauſe they keep no account at all, concerning that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are in themſelves, and in the ſight of God, but they only pretend to be valued, and eſteemed by men: and ſo they joy, and and even look big with it, as men who have attained to the end which they aſpire. But now the true humble man of heart, when he finds that they eſteem, and praiſe, and ſpeak wel of him, then ſhrinks he up, and is the more confounded in himſelf, according to that of the Prophet. <hi>When they exalted me, then did I humble my ſelf the more, and walked on with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170072:50"/>the more confuſion, and fear.</hi> And that with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For he fears leſt he ſhould be the more puniſhed by Almighty God, for wanting that for which he was praiſed, or if perhaps he want it not, yet he fears leſt theſe praiſes ſhould prove to his whole reward; and that ſo they wil come and ſay to him; Thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received the reward of thy good works.</p>
               <p>So that, whereas proud men take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to look big, and grow vain upon the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of men, from thence do ſuch as are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, take occaſion to abaſe and confound themſelves ſo much the more. And this ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> is that which the wiſeman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms; As ſilver is tryed in the melter, &amp; gold in the furnace, ſo is a man tryed by the mouth of him, by whom he is praiſed.</p>
               <p>Gold and ſilver if it be not right, is conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the fire, but if it be good, it is purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and clarified thereby. Juſt ſo, ſaith the wiſeman, is a man proved by praiſe. For when a man is eſteemed, and praiſed, if he exalt himſelf, and grow vain through thoſe praiſes, his gold and ſilver is not good, becauſe the furnace of the tongue conſumes it. But he, who hearing his praiſes, takes occaſion from thence to be the more confounded, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, is moſt perfect ſilver, and gold, becauſe that fire of praiſe did not conſume it: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it remained more purified, and perfected thereby, ſince the man was more confounded and humbled.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:170072:51"/>
               <p>Take you therefore this for a ſigne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you profit in the vertue of <hi>humility,</hi> or no, ſince the Holy Ghoſt delivers it for ſuch. Conſider whether you be ſorry when they eſteem and praiſe you or rather whether you be not content, &amp; glad. We read of <hi>Franciſcus de Borgia,</hi> that no one thing troubled him ſo much, as when he found himſelf to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a Saint, and ſervant of God. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſked once, why he afflicted himſelf ſo much for this, (himſelf not deſiring it, nor procuring it) he made anſwer, that he feared the account which he was to give to God When he found himſelf to be ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man, from that which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be, which is that which we ſaid before of Saint <hi>Gregory.</hi> After this manner are we to be very deeply grounded in the knowledge of our ſelves, that ſo the wind of praiſe, and eſtimation of men, may not blow us up, and draw us out of our nothing. But we muſt rather be the more aſhamed thereof, and confounded thereby, conſidering how falſe thoſe praiſes are, and that we have no ſuch vertue in us, as may deſerve them; and that we be not ſuch as the world conceives, and publiſhes, and as indeed we ought to be.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the fourth ſtep: which is to deſire to be diſeſteemed, and deſpiſed, and to be glad thereof.</head>
               <p>THe fourth ſtep for arriving to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>humility,</hi> is for a man to deſire to be deſpiſed, and diſeſteemed, and be glad of diſhonors, injuries, and contempt. Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith, The man who is truly humble, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to be held by others, in ſmal account, and not to be accounted humble, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and mean, and to be glad thereof. This is the perfection of the ſecond degree of <hi>humility.</hi> And for this reaſon, <hi>humility</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Nard, which is a ſmal and odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hearb, according to that of the Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. <hi>My ſpikenard ſendeth forth the ſmel thereof.</hi> Cant: 1.12. For then doth the Odour of this Nard of <hi>humility,</hi> extend, and impart itſelf to others, when not only you put little eſteem upon your ſelf, but when you alſo deſire, and like wel, that you be deſpiſed and diſeſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> notes that there are two kinds of <hi>humility.</hi> One is when a man conſidering himſelf and perceiving his miſery and baſenes, is convinced by the truth, and holds himſelf in no eſteem, and reſolves that he is worthy to be deſpiſed, and diſhonored
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170072:52"/>by all men. He ſaith, that the former <hi>humility,</hi> namely, that of the underſtanding, was not in Chriſt our Lord; for it was not poſſible for him to think that he deſerved to be held in mean account, and much leſſe to be diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and deſpiſed. Becauſe he underſtood himſelf perfectly wel; and knew that he was true God, and equal to his Father: But the ſecond kind of <hi>humility</hi> was in him, namely, that of the heart, and wil. For in regard of the great love which he bare us, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to abuſe, and diſauthoriſe himſelf, and to ſeem vile, and contemptible in the eyes of men. And he ſaith. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek, and humble of heart.</hi> But as for us, we are to have both theſe <hi>humilities,</hi> becauſe the firſt without the ſecond, is deceitful and falſe. To deſire to ſeem, and to be held for other then that which really you are, is falſhood, and deceit. He who really is humble, and indeed thinks baſely, and diſeſteems, and deſpiſes himſelf, is alſo to be glad, that others may deſpiſe, and diſeſteem him. This is that which we are to learn of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how cordially, and with how ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and will, he embraced diſhonor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for love of us. For he was not ſatisfied with abaſing, and emptying himſelf, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf man, and taking the form of a ſervant upon him, he who was, &amp; is the <hi>Lord</hi> of Heaven and earth; but he would needs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the form, and habit of a ſinner. As ſaith
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170072:52"/>the Apoſtle, <hi>God ſent his Son in the habit, and ſimilitude of a ſinful man.</hi> He took not ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin could not be in him, but he took the mark, and ſign of ſinners, for he would be circumciſed as a ſinner, and baptized amongſt Publicans and ſinners, as if he had been one of them, and would be leſſe eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and judged to be a worſe man, and more unworthy of life then he. To conclude, the deſire which he had to ſuffer affronts, and ſcorns, and reproach, for love of us, was ſo very great, that he thought the hour to ſtay very long, wherin al inebriated, and ſick with love, he might remain naked like another <hi>Noah,</hi> to be ſcorned by men. With baptiſm (ſaith he) am I to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, (which was a baptiſm of blood) and how am I in pain, till I may be able to put it in execution, with deſire have I deſired that the hour may once arrive, wherein there ſhal be nothing for me but buffets, and ſpurns, as to any ſlave. For he knew that they would ſpit upon his face as a blaſphemer; and cloath him with white as a fool, and with purple as a counterfeit King, and above all, that they would load him with ſcourges, which was the puniſhment of malefactors and murdering theeves; and finally with the torment of the Croſſe, in the company of murderers; which then was the moſt ignominious; &amp; reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner of death, that could be found in the world. This is that which Chriſt our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:170072:53"/>deſired with ſo great deſire. As ſaith the Prophet in his name; I was expecting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and affronts, as one would expect ſomewhat which were very pleaſing to him, and were to give him much delight. And the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, he deſired, and thirſted after this hour; that he might as a man may ſay, even have his belly ful of reproaches, and affronts, and ſcorns, as of things to which he carried an extreme appetite, and of which he was very greedy, and indeed they were moſt ſavory to him, for the love of us.</p>
               <p>But now if the Son of God, deſired diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and contempt, with ſo great appetite, and received them with ſo much contentment, and guſt for the love of us, he having no way deſerved them; me thinks it ſhould be no ſuch ſtrange matter for us, who have ſo wel deſerved all kind of diſhonor, and contempt, to deſire for love of him, to be held for no other then what we are, and to rejoyce in ſuffering thoſe diſgraces, and affronts which we deſerve: as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did when he ſaid; For which reaſon I rejoyce in my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and injuries, and affronts, and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and perſecutions, and all kind of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties for Chriſt our Lord. And writing to the Philippians, and treating of his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, he deſires them to bear him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the joy he had, to ſee himſelf in chains for Chriſt our Lord. He had ſuch an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of joy in the perſecutions, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170072:53"/>which he ſuffered, that he had to ſpare for his friends, and therefore he invited them to partake thereof with him. This is that milk which the bleſſed Apoſtles ſucked from the breſt of Chriſt. And ſo we read thus of them; They were ful of joy, &amp; rejoycing, when they were carried Priſoners before their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, and into their Synagogues, and eſteemed it for a great favor, and honor at the hands of God; to be thought worthy to ſuffer affronts, and injuries for the name of Chriſt. Herein they were imitated by other Saints, as for example, by Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Martyr, who when they were carrying him to be martyred at Rome, with many ſcorns, and reproaches, was ful of joy, and ſaid. <hi>It is but now that I begin to be a Diſciple of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> That the perfection of <hi>Humility,</hi> and of all other vertues, conſiſts in performing the act, thereof, with delight, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and how much this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports towards our perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in vertue.</head>
               <p>IT is the common Doctrine of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that the perfection of vertue conſiſts
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170072:54"/>in performing the acts thereof, with delight, and cheerfulnes. For treating of the ſignes, whereby it may be known, whether a man have obtained the habit of any vertue: they ſay they are theſe; when a man works accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that vertue, <hi>Prompte, Faciliter, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectabiliter:</hi> with promptitude, with facility, and with delight. He who hath acquired the habit of any art, or ſcience, performs the works thereof with extream promptitude, and facility; And we ſee, that he who is skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon any Inſtrument, and hath gotten the habit therof, playes with extream promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and facility: and hath no need to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himſelf, nor to think much of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for even though he think of other things he wil yet play wel. Now in the ſelf ſame manner, he who hath acquired the habit of vertue, performs the acts therof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you wil know, whether you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the vertue of <hi>humility,</hi> look firſt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her you perform the works thereof with promptitude, and facility, for if you feel dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, or repugnance in the occaſions which preſent themſelves to you, it is a ſigne that you have not yet acquired the perfection of that vertue. And if, for the bearing them wel, you have need of preventions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I confeſſe it is a good way for the obtaining the perfection of that vertue, but ſtil it is a ſigne that you have not obtained it yet. As he who is to play upon the Lute, muſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170072:54"/>think where to place one finger, and where another, and calling to mind the rules which he was taught, doth wel towards his learning to play; but withal, it is a ſigne that as yet, he hath not gotten the habit of that Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For he who hath got it, needs not cal this or that to mind, to the end that he may play wel. And ſo ſaid <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> He who hath perfectly acquired the habit of any art, finds it ſo eaſie to perform the acts thereof, that he hath no need of cogitation, or deliberation how to do them, for the doing them wel. And ſo the Philoſophers come to ſay, that the vertue of a man is known by his ſudden, and inconſiderate acts, a mans vertue is not known by the acts which he performeth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on great deliberation, but by ſuch as do come from him at unawares.</p>
               <p>Yea, and the Philoſophers ſay yet more then this, <hi>Plutarch</hi> treating how it may be known, when a man hath obtained a vertue, gives two ſignes thereof; and one of them which the great Philoſopher <hi>Zeno</hi> left in writing, is by his Dreams. If even when you are in your dreams, as you are ſleeping, you have no ill impulſes, or unclean imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or when, if you have them, you take no delight, or contentment in them, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: and when you reſiſt the temptation, and delight thereof, even in your Dreams, as if you were awake; this is a ſigne that the vertueis wel rooted in your ſouls, and that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170072:55"/>not only your wil is ſubject to reaſon, but even your ſenſual appetite, and imagination. Juſt ſo, as when Coach-horſes are wel taught, though the Coachman lay the rains on their necks, and perhaps ſleep himſelf, yet they go on their way without making any fault. So ſaith the Philoſopher: They who have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obtained any vertue, and have totally ſubdued the effects, and brutal appetites which repugne to it, go on their right way, even when they ſleep. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth alſo teach us this Doctrine thus. Some ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God carry ſo great an affection to vertue, and to the keeping of Gods Comman dements, and ſo great deteſtation againſt vice, and are ſo accuſtomed, and injured to the reſiſtance of temptations, when they are awake, as that they reſiſt them alſo even when they ſleep. In this ſort do ſome declare that place of Saint <hi>Paul: Sive vigilemus, ſive dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus, ſimul cum illo vivamus:</hi> which imports not only that both living and dying, we muſt ever live with Chriſt, which is the common expoſition: but moreover, that the zealous ſervants of God, muſt ever live with Chriſt, and that not only waking, but even ſleeping alſo, and dreaming.</p>
               <p>The Philoſophers go yet further, and ſay, that the third condition or ſigne, whereby it may be known, if a man have perfectly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any vertue, is when he performs the the works thereof <hi>delelectabiliter,</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170072:55"/>and guſt, for this is the principal ſigne wherein the perfection of vertue conſiſts. If therefore you will ſee whether you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the vertue of <hi>humility,</hi> examine your ſelves by that rule, which we delivered in the laſt Chapter; and ſee whether you be as glad of any diſhonor, and affront, as worldly men uſe to be of honor, and eſtimation.</p>
               <p>But beſides, that all this is neceſſary for arriving to the perfection of any vertue, there is yet another thing of very great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, towards the continuing, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring therein. For in fine, til we arrive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the actions of vertue, with guſt and joy, it wil be a thing of much difficulty, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in vertue. Saint <hi>Dorotheus</hi> ſaith, that this was the common Doctrine of thoſe antient <hi>Fathers.</hi> Thoſe antient <hi>Fathers</hi> were wont to ſay, and they held it for a moſt certain truth, that whatſoever was not performed with guſt and joy, could not laſt any long time. It may wel happen, that for ſome fit, you will keep ſilence, and live with modeſty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, but yet, til this flow from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry interior of the heart, and till by the good cuſtome which you uſe, you make it grow as it were to be connatural to you, and ſo you come to perform it with ſweetneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, you wil not continue long therein, but it will paſſe, as being affected, and forced. <hi>Et nullum violentum perpetuum.</hi> Nothing forc'd, or violent, can long continne. For this reaſon it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170072:56"/>imports ſo much, to exerciſe the acts of any vertue with ſuch conſtancy, as thereby to root it in the ſoul, which muſt even drink it up in ſuch ſort, that it may fall, even as it were of it ſelf, upon the vertue, and they may ſeem to be acts of our own nature, for ſo we ſhal perform them with joy and guſt. By theſe means we may obtain a kind of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we ſhal continue, and perſevere ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. This is that, which the Prophet ſaith, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that man, whoſe whole contentment, joy, &amp; gladnes is in the law of the Lord, &amp; who make it his delights, &amp; entertainments; for that man wil yeeld the fruit of good works, like a tree which is planted by the River ſide.</p>

               <p>THey ordinarily uſe to aſſign two ſeveral wayes, or means, for the obtaining of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertues. The one is of reaſons, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, which may convince, and animate us thereunto; and the other is exerciſe of the acts of that vertue, whereby we may acquire the habits thereof To begin with the firſt kind of means, one of the moſt principal, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170072:56"/>efficatious conſiderations, whereof we may help our ſelves towards being humble, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moſt principal, and moſt efficatious of them all, is the example of Chriſt our <hi>Lord,</hi> our <hi>Maſter,</hi> and our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> whereof though we have already ſaid ſomewhat, there will ever be enough to add. The whole life of Chriſt our <hi>Lord,</hi> was a moſt perfect Original of <hi>Humility,</hi> from the very time of his birth, to that other of his expiring upon the Croſſe. But yet to this purpoſe, St: Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine doth particularly ponder the example which he gave us, by waſhing the feet of his Diſciples, upon that Thurſday of the laſt ſupper, when he was even upon the very brim of his paſſion, and death, Chriſt our <hi>Lord</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> was not content with having given us the examples of his whole life paſt, nor yet with them alſo, which he was ſhortly to give in his paſſion, the ſame being then ſo cloſe at hand, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was to appear according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the very laſt, or loweſt of men: and as the royal Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith the <hi>very reproach, and ſcorn of men, yea the very outcaſt of the world:</hi> But our Lord Jeſus knowing, that his hour was now at hand, wherein he was to paſſe out of this World, to his <hi>Father,</hi> he carried a great love to his Diſciples, &amp; was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that he would expreſſe it now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of his life. And ſupper being ended, he riſes from the Table, he puts off
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170072:57"/>his upper garment, he girds a towel to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he puts water into a baſen, he proſtrates himſelf at the feet of his Diſciples, yea and of <hi>Judas</hi> too: he waſhes them with thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine hands of his, and he wipes them with the towel wherewith he was girt. O unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable miſtery! What is this O Lord, which thou art doing? ſaith the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Thou, O Lord, to waſh my feet? The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples undeſtood not then what he did, ſaith our Lord, <hi>You underſtand not now what I am do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but yet ere long, I will declare it to you. He returns to the Table, and declares the miſtery thus at large. You cal me Maſter, and <hi>Lord,</hi> and you ſay well, for ſo I am. If then I being your Maſter, and your Lord, have humbled my ſelf, and have waſhed your feet, you are alſo to do the like to one another. I have given you an example, to the end, that you may learn of me, and do as I have done. This is the miſtery, that you learn to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves, as I have humbled my ſelf. The importance of this vertue of <hi>humility</hi> is on the one ſide ſo great, and ſo is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty alſo on the other, that our Lord was not content with ſo many examples, as he had already given us, and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> who wel knew our weaknes, and who perfectly underſtood the malignity of that peccant humor, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our nature was ſick, he would needs give us this ſtrong Phyſick againſt it, and put it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170072:57"/>amongſt the chief Legacies of his laſt Will, and Teſtament, that ſo it might remain the more deeply imprinted in all our hearts.</p>
               <p>Upon thoſe words of Chriſt our Lord; <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek, and humble of heart:</hi> Saint Auguſtine exclaims thus: O ſoveraign Doctrine, O Maſter, &amp; <hi>Lord</hi> of all men, into whom death entred by means of pride, what is it O Lord which thou wilt have us come and learn of thee? That I am meek, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of heart. This is that which you are to learn of me. In this are the treaſures of the wiſdom, and knowledge of the Father ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up, which have been hidden in thee, that thou tell us, for the higheſt point, that we muſt come and learn of thee that: Thou art meek, and humble of heart: it is ſo high, and great a thing, for a man to make himſelf little, that unleſſe thou who art ſo great, hadſt made thy ſelf little, no man could have learnt it of thee? yea ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſo great, and ſo hard a thing it is, for a man to humble himſelf, and make himſelf little, that if God himſelf had not humbled himſelf, and become little, men would never have been brought to humble themſelves. For there is nothing ſo deeply conveyed into their very bowels, and ſo incorporated, as it were, into their hearts, as this deſire of being honored, and eſteemed, and therefore was all this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to the end, that we might grow to be humble; for ſuch Phyſick did the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170072:58"/>of our pride require; and ſuch a wound, ſuch a cure. But if ſuch a receipt as this, for God to have made himſelf man, and to have humbled himſelf ſo much for our ſakes, will not recover us, and cure our pride, I know not ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> what will ever be able to do it. If to ſee the Majeſty of our <hi>Lord</hi> ſo abaſed, and humbled, will not ſuffice to make us aſhamed of deſiring to be honored and eſteemed and that hereupon we yet will not grow to a thirſt of being deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, and abaſed with him, and for the love of him, I know not what will ever ſerve the turn. Holy <hi>Guericus</hi> being amazed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the great example of our Lords <hi>humility,</hi> exclaims and expreſſes, that which it is reaſon that we ſhould alſo ſay, and draw from hence. Thou haſt overcome <hi>O Lord,</hi> thou haſt overcome my pride, thine exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath bound me hand and foot: behold I render, and deliver up my ſelf into thy hands for an everlaſting ſlave.</p>
               <p>It is alſo an admirable conceit which the glorious Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> brings to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, The Son of <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) ſaw two creatures, and both were generous, noble, and capable of that bleſſed ſtate to which they had been created by Almighty God, and they both loſt themſelves, becauſe they would needs be like him. God created the Angels, and inſtantly Lucifer had a mind to be like Almighty God. And then he carried
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170072:58"/>others after him, and God caſt them inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down to Hell, and ſo of Angels, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came devils. God alſo created man, &amp; inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the devil ſtruck him with his own leapro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and poyſon. They fell gluttonoully upon what he told them, namely that they ſhould be as God, and then they broke the divine commandment, and ſo became like the devil. The Prophet <hi>Eliſus</hi> ſaid to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Giezi</hi> after he took the preſents of the leprous <hi>Naaman.</hi> Thou haſt taken the goods of <hi>Naaman,</hi> and behold his leaproſie ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſtick to thee, and to all thy deſcendents for ever. This was the judgment of God againſt man, that ſince he would needs have the riches of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> which was his pride, he ſhould alſo have his leaproſie, vvhich was the puniſhment thereof. You ſee therefore here, that man was alſo undone, and made like the devil, becauſe he vvould needs be like God. And what might novv be fit for Son of God to do, finding his eternal <hi>Father</hi> to be ſo jealous, and careful to maintain his ovvn honor. I ſee ſaith he, that by my occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions my Father looſeth his creatures. The Angels vvould needs be as I am, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threvv themſelves, man vvould alſo be ſo, and he vvas alſo overthrovvn. They al have envy at me, and vvould fain be ſuch as I am. Well then, behold ſaith the Son of God, I vvill go in ſuch a form, that vvhoſoever vvil from hencefoorth become like me, ſhall not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170072:59"/>loſe but gain, and for this came the Son of God from Heaven, and made himſelf man. Otherefore let ſuch a bounty and mercy be bleſſed, and praiſed, and glorified, which moved Almighty God to condeſcend to that ſo great deſire which we had to be like him; for now we may be as God, not according to falſhood, and with a lye, and according to what the devil ſaid, but according to truth, and not now with pride, &amp; malice, but with much ſanctity, &amp; <hi>humility.</hi> Upon thoſe words, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a child is born.</hi> The ſame Saint ſaith, ſince God being ſo great, made himſelf little for us, let us procure to humble our ſelves, and make our ſelves alſo little, that ſo it may not be to no purpoſe for us, that the great God made himſelf ſo little as to become a child for us. Becauſe if you become not like this little child, you ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of ſome humane conſiderations, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whereby we are to help our ſelves for being humble.</head>
               <p>FRom the very beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, we have been declaring many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and reaſons, which may help and animate us much towards the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170072:59"/>of the vertue of <hi>humility:</hi> ſhewing that it is the root and foundation of all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the ſhort way to acquire them, the means to conſerve them, and that in fine, if we poſſeſſe this, we ſhall be maſters of them all. But yet, that it may appear that we mean not to carry it all, by the only way of ſpirit, it will not be amiſſe, that we deliver ſome humane conſiderations; and reaſons, which may be more proportionable, and connatural to our weaknes, to the end, that being ſo convinced not only by way of ſpirit, and of perfection, but even of natural reaſon alſo, we may have both more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and more affection to the contempt of honour and eſtimation of the world, and to proceed in the way of <hi>humility,</hi> for all this will be needful, for the acquiring of a thing ſo hard as this, and ſo it will be well that we help our ſelves of it.</p>
               <p>Let it therefore be the firſt, that we put our ſelves to conſider, and examine at good leiſure, and with attention what thing this honour and eſtimation of men is, which makes ſo continual War againſt us, and gives us all ſo much to do. Let us ſee what weight and bulk it hath, that ſo we may eſteem it no better then it deſerves, and may animate our ſelves to deſpiſe it, and not continue in ſo much error as now we find our ſelves ſubject to. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid very well, that there are many things which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170072:60"/>we hold to be great, not becauſe indeed they are great, but becauſe our poornes, and wretchednes is ſuch, that the ſmal ſeems great, &amp; the little much to us, and he brings the example of that weight which is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily carried by Ants: which in reſpect of their Body is very great, being yet very ſmal in it ſelf; and juſt ſo it is with the honor, and eſtimation of the World. If you deny it, I would aſk whether you be indeed either the better or the worſe, becauſe they eſteem you not? Infallibly you are not. Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Neither is the ill man made good by being eſteemed &amp; praiſed, nor the good man made il by being diſcommended and reproached.</hi> Think of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> what thou wilt, that which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, is that my conſcience may not reproach me in the ſight of God. This is that which imports, the reſt is foolery, for it neither gives, nor takes away. This is that which another ſaith, What is a man the better for being praiſed by another. And as much as any man is in the ſight of God, ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is, and no more. As was ſaid by the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Pau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. For not he that commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelf is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 10.18. Saint <hi>Augaſtine</hi> brings a good compariſon to this purpoſe. <hi>Pride and eſtimation of the world, is not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but ſwelling, and wind.</hi> And as when any part is ſwelled, it ſeems, but is not truly great, ſo proud men, who are valued and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170072:60"/>eſteemed by the world, ſeem as if they were great, but they are not ſo; becauſe that is not greatnes, but ſwelling. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſickly men, who ſometimes are thought to be upon recovery, becauſe they ſeem to look fat, and wel, but that fatnes is not ſound and good, but it is rather ſickly and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. So ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is the applauſe and eſtimation of the World, it may puff you up, but it cannot make you great. If then it be ſo, that the opinion and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World is not any thing of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in it ſelf, but rather of ſicknes, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, why do we go up and down like Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, ſucking in wind with our mouths open, that ſo we may be the more ſwellen, and ſick? It is better for a man to be in health, though he ſeem ſick, then to be ſick and ſeem ſound; ſo alſo is it better to be good, though he ſeem wicked, then to be wicked, and be held for good. For what good will it do you to be held vertuous, and ſpiritual, if indeed you be not ſo. Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> upon theſe words. <hi>His works ſhall praiſe him in the gates.</hi> Not the vain praiſes of men, but your good works muſt needs defend and praiſe you, vvhen you appear in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> recounts how in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Hiconia,</hi> there was a certain Monk who vvas generally in the opinion of being a Saint, and eſpecially for being very abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170072:61"/>and ful of penance alſo otherwiſe. But the hour of his death being come, he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that all the Monks might be called to him. For their parts they vvere very glad of it, as conceiving that they vvere to hear from him, ſome matter of much edification, but he trembled, and vvas ful of anguiſh, and found himſelf compelled from vvithin, to declare his true ſtate to them. And ſo he made them know that he was damned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all his life had been but hypocrifie. For when they thought he faſted, and did much penance, he eat ſecretly when they ſaw him not, and for this ſaith he, am I now delivered over to a terrible, and furious Beaſt, whoſe tail hath wreathed it ſelf about, and tied my feet, and his head is already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring now into my mouth, to fetch out, and carry away my ſoul with him for ever. And with theſe words he expired to the great amazement of them all. And now, what was this miſerable creature the better for having been reputed a Saint.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Anthanaſius</hi> compares proud men, who go in ſearch of honour, to children to hunt butterflies. Others compare them to ſpiders, who deſtroy and defeat themſelves in making their webs, for the hunting of flies. According to that of <hi>Iſa. They weave the ſpiders web, Iſa:</hi> 59.5. For ſo the proud man ever diſimbowels himſelf, and caſts up as it were his very maw, that he may obtain a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170072:61"/>humane praiſe. We read in the life of a certain honorable Perſon, that he ever both carried, and ſhewed a moſt particular ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and deteſtation againſt this opinion, and eſtimation of the world, for he ſaid that it was the cauſe of great miſchiefs, and the impediment of many bleſſings. And ſo they hear him cry thus out ſometimes, with much earneſtnes, and many ſighs. O opinion, O opinion and eſtimation of the world, how many miſchiefs haſt thou wrought already, how many workeſt thou now, and how many wilt thou continue to work.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of other humane reaſons which will help us to be humble.</head>
               <p>SAint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> upon thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul. Not to think of himſelf more highly then he ought to think, but to think ſoberly. Rom.</hi> 12.3. goes proving very expreſly, that the proud and arrogant perſon, is not only wick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed and ſinful, but a ſtark fool withall. To prove this, he brings that of <hi>Iſaiah. The fool ſpeak fooliſh things, and by the follies which he utters, you ſhall underſtand him indeed to be a fool.</hi> Wel then, let us obſerve the follies which are uttered by the arrogant, and proud man and we ſhal quickly ſee what a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170072:62"/>fool he is. What is that, which the firſt. proud creature uttered, which was <hi>Lucifer</hi> I will mount up to heaven, I will place and exalt my throne above the clouds, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, above the ſtars, I will be like the moſt <hi>High.</hi> What could be more fooliſhly, and diſ-jointedly conceived. And in the tenth Chapter, he ſets down very arrogant and fooliſh words of <hi>Aſſur,</hi> King of the <hi>Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> vvherevvith he glorified himſelf in that, vvith his povverful hand he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and ſubdued all the Kings of the earth. As vvhen a man takes the poor little Birds out of a neſt, vvhich are bred up by the elder Birds, and as a man vvho goes to gather the eggs vvhich are not defended, ſo have I (ſaith he) conquered all the earth vvith the ſame facility, nor was there any one who durſt ſo much as ſtir, yea, or ſo much as open his mouth againſt me, either in earneſt or in jeſt. What greater folly can there be then this, ſaith Saint <hi>Chriſoſtom?</hi> And there he alſo brings in divers other ſpeeches of proud men, which diſcover ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſufficiently what fools they are, ſo that if you hear, and mark their words, you will not eaſily diſcern whether they be words of a proud man, or of ſome other who is a meer ſot, ſo abſurd, and diſ-jointed they are. And ſo we daily ſee that as fools move us to laughter, with what they ſay and do, ſo do alſo proud men in their converſation, by the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170072:62"/>arrogant words which they utter, redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own praiſe, and by the geſtures which they uſe, and by the ſtate and fooliſh gravity wherewith they walk, and by the high account which forſooth, they will needs have men make both of their perſons, and of all that which is theirs, and by the eſtimation wherein they hold themſelves. And Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> adds, that the ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or folly of proud men, is worſe, and worthy of greater reproach and ſhame, then that which is natural; for this carries no fault, or ſin with it, but the other doth. From whence alſo follows another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe two follies, that they who are natural fools, cauſe pity, and move all men to be ſorry, and compaſſionate of their miſery; Whereas the folly of proud men moves not others to compaſſion and pity, but to laughter and ſcorn.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time, proud men are ſots, and ſo we muſt proceed with them as ſuch. For as we muſt condeſcend, and ſeem to that which fools ſay, that ſo we may have peace with them, (though indeed the thing be not ſo, or at leaſt though we underſtand it not after that manner) (but yet ſtill we wil not contradict them, becauſe in <hi>fine,</hi> they are fools) juſt ſo do we proceed vvith proud men. And indeed this humor, and madnes raign, ſo much in the World at this day, that novv vve can hardly converſe vvith
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170072:63"/>men, but vve muſt be fain to ſmooth them, and to ſay that vvhich is not ſo, no nor is ſo conceived by us. For the other takes ſo much delight to underſtand, that his ſtories give contentment, and ſeem ſo vvell to others, that there is no better way to oblige him, &amp; to gain his good wil then by praiſing him. And this ſaith the <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> is one of the vanities &amp; follies which he ſaw in the world, namely, <hi>That wicked men were praiſed as good; becauſe they were in high place, I ſaw the wicked buried, who while they lived were in the holy place, and they were praiſed in the City, (ſo the vulgar Latine hath it) as for righteous works: this alſo is vanity.</hi> What greater vanity, and madnes can there be, then to praiſe men, when they think there is no cauſe for it, yea and to do as many times is done, when ſome praiſe others, for that which they did ill, or at leaſt for what they thought was ill done. And the jeſt is, that they have already told others what they really think of you, but yet with you, becauſe forſooth you muſt be kept contented, they ſtick not for the moſt part to lye. At other times they are fain to ſeek out by wayes, that ſo they may be able without lying to ſpeak well of that, which indeed they do not like, and the matter is, becauſe they muſt treat you, and condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to you as they would, to ſome ſtupid for or fool. The while, that other conceives that you are of the ſame humor with him,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170072:63"/>and that you are alſo glad when you are dealt with after the ſame manner, and that the beſt morſel of the meat which he can be able to give yo, after you have preached, or performed ſome ſuch thing, is to tel you that you diſcharged it excellently wel, and that all the World was highly pleaſed with you, and he treats you thus, to keep you in contentment, or elſe to gain your good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and affection, whereof perhaps he hath need; but that for which this ſerves indeed is to make you a veryer fool then you were before, becauſe he praiſes you for what you ſaid, or did ill, and ſo you are the more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, and confirmed in committing the ſame errors another time. Men dare not now a dayes ſpeak what they think, becauſe they know that truth is grown troubleſome. Truth procures hatred. And they know that he who is mad, and frantick refuſes to take Phyſick, and ſpits in the Doctors face, when he deſires to cure him: ſo doth the proud man reſiſt admonition, and reformation, and therefore men will not tell ſuch a one that which will diſcontent him, but they think it the ſhorter way to make him think they like that, which yet indeed they miſlike, and the other beleeves all, and is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with it: Whereby alſo we may ſee the truth of that which we delivered in the laſt Chapter, namely, how great a vanity, and madnes it is, to make any account of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170072:64"/>praiſes of men, ſince we ſee that in this age, all is complement, deceit, flattery, and lies. For even they are able to derive, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret the word after this manner, <hi>Complimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cumploy miento,</hi> that is to ſay, I comply, and I lye, and the cauſe why I lye, is that I may comply.</p>
               <p>Bu prou men ſaith, Saint <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> are abhorred by all. Firſt by Almighty God as the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſaith: <hi>Every arrogant man is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abomination in the ſight of God, Prov:</hi> 16.5. And of ſeven things which God abhors, he places pride for the firſt. And not only are they abhorred by God, but by men alſo. As they who have ill lungs, have ſo unſavery breath, that there is no induring of it, ſo alſo have proud men.</p>
               <p>But novv even this very World, gives them here the pay of their pride, for it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them in that very thing, to vvhich they moſt pretend, and all proves vvith them the contrary vvay. They pretend to be valued, &amp; eſteemed by all, and they are held by al to be ſots, and fools. They pretend to be beloved by al, &amp; indeed they are abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all. By their betters, becauſe theſe men make themſelves their equals, by their equals, becauſe theſe men make themſelves their betters; by their inferiors, becauſe theſe men depreſſe them more then they ſhould. Even the domeſticks, and ſervants ſpeak il of their maſter, and indure him not. Where pride is, there is reproach. And on
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170072:64"/>the other ſide, the humble man is valued, and eſteemed, affected, and beloved by all. As children who for their goodnes, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, their ſimplicity of heart are belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> are the humble For that clearnes and plainnes of thei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeech, and that converſing without dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes or deceit, even robs men of their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hearts. <hi>Humility</hi> is a loadſtone which dravvs all mens affections to it: and it ſeems that all men if they could, vvould take this <hi>humble</hi> man into their very hearts.</p>
               <p>To the end, that vve may at length be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſvvaded that it is a meer madnes to go deſiring, and procuring the eſtimation, and opinion of men. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> makes a very good dilemma, and concludes thus. Either it is madnes in the Son of God, to abaſe and empty himſelf ſo far, as to chooſe contempt, and diſhonor for himſelf, or elſe it is extream madnes in us, to be in ſo great deſire of the honor, and eſtimation of the World. It vvas not folly, or madnes in the Son of God, neither could it be, though the World thought it vvas as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. <hi>To the blind and proud Gentiles, and Jews, Chriſt our Lord ſeems to be a folly, or madnes: but unto us who have the light of Faith, he is infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and love.</hi> Novv if his vvere infinite vviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it wil follovv that ours is ſtupidity, and folly; and that vve are very ſots in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch account as vve do of the opinions eſtimation, and honor of the World.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> That the certain way for a man to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, and eſteemed even by men, is to give himſelf to vertue, and humility.</head>
               <p>IF vvithal that vvhich vve have ſaid, you vvil not yet forſake theſe ſumes, and abate that edg and deſire of honor, and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but will ſtil be ſaying, that in fine it is a great point, to hold a good opinion, and eſtimation amongſt men, and that this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports very much, even for the edification of your Neighbors, and for many other things, and that the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> counſels us to have a care thereof. Have a care of thy good name. I ſay let it be ſo, in the name of God; I am content that you have care to keep the good name you have, and that you be eſteemed, and held in good opinion by the World. But yet I give you to underſtand withal, that if you deſire it, as you ſay you do, you err, even in order to that for vvhich you deſire it, and that you ſhall never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that end by this means, but the direct contrary. The ſafe and certain vvay vvherby you ſhall infallibly come to be much valued and eſteemed by men, is vertue, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith. Procure eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170072:65"/>one of you in particular, to be a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, and to be the meaneſt, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt of all the reſt, and that you may appear to be ſo by your manner of living; and in the occaſions vvhich ſhal preſent themſelves, ſo you ſhall be valued and eſteemed by all men. This is indeed the honor of a religious man, vvho hath forſaken the World, and profeſſeth himſelf to be a Citizen of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And on the contrary ſide, for him to deſire to be valued and eſteemed by men, is a diſhonor and affront to him, for vvhich men vvould juſtly deſpiſe him. Becauſe this man began to build, and could not finiſh it. And ſo it is vvith ſuch as deſire, and pretend to be valued, and eſteemed by men, which indeed is to return to the World vvith the heart. For this eſtimation is the moſt truly, and properly belonging to the World, and that vvhich you forſook, and from which you fled, vvhen you made that holy vow at your Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Will you cleerly ſee how ſhamefull, and reproachful a thing it is, for ſuch men to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the eſtimation of the World, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes to aſpire towards perfection? Let ſuch a deſire come but once ſo to light, as that others may diſcern that you deſire it, and you will quickly find how much your ſelf will be confounded, and out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that any ſuch thing ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of you. We have a very good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170072:66"/>of this, in the holy Goſpel. The Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts relate, that the Apoſtles went once with Chriſt our Lord, but yet at ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him, that they might think he heard them not, and ſo they went diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and arguing amongſt themſelves. Which of them was to be the chief, and beſt man amongſt them. But when they were al come home to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> he aſked them what that wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, about which they had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing upon the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And the holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel faith, that the poor men were ſo aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, &amp; out of countenance to ſee their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and ambition diſcovered, that they had not one word to ſay. But they held their peace. <hi>Mark:</hi> 9.35. For by the way they had diſputed among themſelves, who ſhould be the greateſt. But then did the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World take them in hand, and ſay. You muſt know, O you my Diſciples, that amongſt wordly men, and them who live according to the cuſtome of the world, they who govern and command, will be eſteemed, and honored as great Perſons. But in my ſchool it is directly otherwiſe; for the greateſt there is to be the leaſt and muſt be a ſervant to all the reſt. If any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be firſt, the ſame ſhall be laſt of all, and ſervant of all: <hi>Mark</hi> 9.35. By nothing can you looſe more then if once it come o be found, that you deſire and pretend to be valued and eſteemed by men, and that you
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170072:66"/>are ſtanding upon puntilios, and ſpend your thoughts upon ſuch toyes as theſe. And ſo <hi>John Climacus</hi> ſaith very well. That vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath many times been an occaſion of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy to the owners, for it hath made them ſet upon things whereby they have proclaimed their vanity, and ambition, and ſo came to infamy, and confuſion. <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> adds, that pride blinds the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch ſort, that many times, the more pride you have, the leſſe you know it: and ſo as being blind, a proud man ſaith, and doth ſuch things, as that if himſelf could ſee them well, he then would not for the World either ſay, or do them, even though there were no ſuch thing as God, or vertue, but meerly for that reputation, and honors ſake, which is ſo eagerly purſued. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times doth it happen, that a man is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and complains, becauſe they made no reckoning of him, in ſuch an occaſion, or that they preferred ſome other before him in ſuch a buſines; he conceiving that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, and that it will redound to his diſhonor, and diminnution, and that it will lye as a note upon him, and that others will diſcover it, and reflect upon it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this colour, he gives them to underſtand the exception which he takes, and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which he ſuſtains, by means whereof in very deed, he remains more noted, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eſteemed, becauſe he is held now for proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170072:67"/>for a man that ſtands upon certain points of honor, which amongſt humble, and good Chriſtians, is a moſt abominable kind of thing. Whereas if he would have paſſed it over, and neglected himſelf, and given way, that ſuperiors might do their will, he might have gained much honor, and been much eſteemed for it.</p>
               <p>So that though there were no ſuch thing as a way of ſpirit, but that men were only to live in a courſe of prudence, and diſcretion, yea and even according to the very Laws of the World, the true and certain way for a man to be valued, eſteemed, affected, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by men, is to addict himſelf ſeriouſly to acquire vertue, and humility. Even among the Gentiles, it is recounted of <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus</hi> who was the chief of the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus,</hi> and accounted a Wiſe man amongſt them, that being aſked by <hi>Socrates,</hi> how a man ſhould do to make all others eſteem, and conceive wel of him, made this anſwer. If you ſhall procure to be ſuch, as you deſire to ſeem. And afterward, the ſame man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked concerning the ſame thing, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus. If you ſpeak ever well, and do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And it is related of another Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that he had a great friend who in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion ſpoke all good of him, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him one day, that he owned him much, becauſe whereſoever he chanced to be, he praiſed him much, and ſpake much of his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170072:67"/>vertues, the Philoſopher anſwered him thus. I pay you wel for your pains, by living in ſuch ſort, as that you may not lye, in any of thoſe things which you have ſaid of me.</p>
               <p>But now we ſay not, for all this, that we muſt give our ſelves to vertue, and <hi>humility,</hi> to the end that we may be valued, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by men, for that were pride, and a perverſe error. That which we ſay is, that if we procure to be humble indeed, and at the heart, we ſhal be valued, and eſteemed much, whether we will or no: nay, and the more we fly from honor, and eſtimation, and the more we ſhall deſire to be deſpiſed, it will follow us the faſter, juſt as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow doth the body. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> treating of the devout matron <hi>Paula,</hi> ſaith. Flying from honor, and eſtimation, ſhe was more honored and eſteemed. For as the ſhadow whilſt a man flies from it, follows him, and on the contrary ſide, if he follows the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow it flies from him, and the faſter he runs from it, the more it flies, and ſo, as that he can never overtake it; juſt ſo it is, in the point of honor, and eſtimation.</p>
               <p>This was taught us by Chriſt our Lord in the holy Goſpel, when he diſcourſed of the way men were to hold in publick meetings. When you ſhall be invited (ſaith he) ſit not down in the higheſt place, leſt perhaps a gueſt of greater quality then your ſelf may have been deſired; and when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170072:68"/>they wiſh you to quit that place, and then you deſcend to the loweſt with much confuſion, and ſhame. But that which you are to do, is to ſit down in the loweſt place, that ſo when he comes who invited you, he may cauſe you to aſcend higher, and thus you ſhal receive honor before all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Which in ſubſtance is the ſame thing, that the Holy Ghoſt had ſaid before, by the mouth of the <hi>Wiſeman: Prov:</hi> 25.6, 7. Put not forth thy ſelf in the preſence of the King; and ſtand not in the place of great men. For better it is that it be ſaid unto thee, come up hither: then that thou ſhouldſt be put lower in the preſence of the Prince, vvhom thine eyes have ſeen. But the parable concludes with ſaying. For every man who exalts himſelf ſhall be humbled, and he who humbles himſelf ſhall be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Here you ſee, how the humble man who chooſes the loweſt, &amp; meaneſt place, is valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eſteemed, not only before God, but before men alſo; and on the other ſide, the proud man, who ſeeks the beſt, and higheſt ſeat, is undervalued, and deſpiſed. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> exclaims, and ſaith. O holy <hi>Humility,</hi> how unlike art thou to pride. Pride O my Brethren, caſt <hi>Lucifer</hi> down out of Heaven: but humility brought the Son of God from thence, to become man. Pride caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe: but humility carried the good theef in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="5 letters">

                  </gap> Pride divided and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170072:68"/>confounded the tongues of the Gyants: but <hi>humility</hi> united al them which were divided. Pride transformed <hi>Nabucadonoſor</hi> into a beaſt; but humility made <hi>Joſeph</hi> Lord of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and Prince of the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Pride drowned <hi>Pharao,</hi> but humility raiſed, and exalted <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP: XXI.</hi> That <hi>Humility</hi> is the means to obtain inward peace of mind, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, this cannot be had.</head>
               <p>LEarn of me, for I am meek, and humble of heart, and you ſhall find reſt unto your ſouls. One of the chief, and moſt effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious reaſons which we can bring for the animating our ſelves to deſpiſe honor, and to procure to be humbled, is that which Chriſt our Redeemer propounds to us, in theſe words, namely, that it is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means, for the obtaining of interior quietnes, and peace to the ſoul, a thing ſo much deſired by al ſpiritual men, and which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſets down for one of the fruits of the Holy Ghoſt. Gal: 5.22. But the fruit of the ſpirit is love, joy, peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That we may the better underſtand this quietnes, and peace, which the humble man enjoyes,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170072:69"/>it will be well, that we conſider the diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and reſtleſnes, which the proud man ever carries in his heart, for one contrary is the better known by the other. The holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is full of ſentences, which declare that wicked men have not peace. There is no peace ſaith the Lord unto the wicked, Iſa. 48.22.</p>
               <p>For they have healed the hurt of the Daughter of my People ſlightly, ſaying, peace, peace, when there is no peace, Jer: 8.11. Waſting and deſtruction are in their paths. Iſa. 59.7, 8. The way of peace they know not. They know not what kind of thing peace is, and though ſometimes they may exteriorly ſeem to have peace, yet that is not true peace; for there within, in their very heart, they have a War, which their conſcience is ever making againſt them. Behold for peace I had great bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Iſa: 38.17. Wicked men ever live with bitterneſſe, and ſadnes of heart.</p>
               <p>But proud men are ſubject after a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner to great unquietnes, and want of peace. And the expreſſe reaſon here of we may very well collect, out of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who ſaith, that inſtantly envy grows out of pride, whoſe Daughter it is: and that it is never to be ſo und, without the company of this hateful iſſue. Which two ſins of pride, and envy, make the devil to be that very devil which he is. Now then, by this we may
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170072:69"/>underſtand what miſchief theſe two ſins are likely to work, in the heart of man: ſince they are bad enough to make the devil a devil. He who on the one ſide, ſhal be ful of pride, and of the deſire of honor, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſees that things ſucceeds not according to his deſign; and on the other ſide, is alſo full of envy, which is the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pride, and is ever in company thereof, when he ſhall ſee that others are more eſteemed, and preferred before him, wil cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be full of bitternes, and reſtleſnes: for there is nothing which ſo wounds the poor man, nor reaches ſo near to his very heart, as thoſe things aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The holy Scripture paints this unto us, to the life, in the perſon of that proud Aman. He was the favourite of King <hi>Aſuerus,</hi> above al the Princes Grandes of his Dominions. He had a great aboundance of temporal goods, and riches, and was ſo highly valued, and eſteemed by all, that now it ſeemed that there was nothing left for him to deſire.</p>
               <p>And yet nevertheleſſe, it gave him ſo great pain, that one ſingle man, and he a mean perſon, who ſat uſually at the gate of the Pallace, made no reckoning of him, nor did him reverence, nor roſe up, nor ſtirred from his place whilſt he was paſſing by, that he eſteemed nor all the poſſeſſed at a ruſh, in compariſon of the diſtemper, and pain to which he was put thereby. This himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170072:70"/>by way of complaint to his Wife, and freinds, whilſt in diſcourſe he was ſpeaking to them of his proſperity, and power other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Eſt: 5.13. Yet all this availeth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo long as I ſee <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Jew ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Kings gate. That ſo we may ſee the reſtleſneſſe of a proud man, and the high waves, and ſtorms which toſſe his heart. (According to that of the Prophet. <hi>The wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt.</hi>) <hi>Iſac</hi> 57.20. Like a Sea which is angry and fierce, ſo high goes the heart of a proud and wicked man. And now the rage which grew in the heart of <hi>Aman,</hi> upon that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was ſo great, that he diſdained to lay hold upon <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> who was but a poor particular man, unleſſe knowing him to be a Jew by Nation, he might alſo procure war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants from the King, by Vertue whereof, all that race of men, who were to be found in his Dominions might be put to death. He commanded alſo a very high gibet to be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in a Court of his own houſe, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he meant that <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> ſhould be hanged. But his dream fell out far otherwiſe, and the Jews proved to be the men, who executed upon their enemies, the ſentence which had been given againſt them: and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> himſelf was hanged upon the very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, which he had prepared for <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:170072:70"/>
               <p>But firſt, there happened a ſound morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to him, and it was this. He going one morning very early to the Court, in order to the revenge which he had deſigned, and to obtain a Warrant from the King for the executing thereof, it hapned that the night before, the King not having been able to fleep, commanded them to bring the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Chronicles of his Times, and when by courſe of reading, they were come to thoſe particulars of what <hi>Mardocheus</hi> had done in ſervice of the King, by diſcovery of a certain treaſon, which ſome of his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had plotted againſt him, he inquired what reward had been given that man, for that ſervice; and they told him none at all. The King then aſked who was without, and whether yet men were come to make their Court. They told him that <hi>Aman</hi> was there, and ſo he was bidden to enter. The King then asked him this queſtion. What will it be fit to do for that man, to whom the King deſires to do honor. Now <hi>Aman</hi> conceiving that himſelf was to be the man, to whom that honor was to be done, made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: The man whom the King deſires to honor, ſhould be clad in the Kings Princely robes, and ſet upon the Kings own Horſe, with the Crown Royal upon his head: and one of the prime men of the Court ſhould go before him, leading the Horſe in his hand, and proclaiming, thus in the publique
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170072:71"/>places of the City. Thus is he to be honored whom the King will honor. Well then, ſaid the King, go thou to that <hi>Mardochoeus,</hi> who keeps about the Court gate, and do al that to him, which thou haſt ſaid to me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thou faile in no one circumſtance. Think now what wound of anguiſh, that wicked, and proud heart would feel, but in fine, he durſt not fail in executing the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a hair. It ſeemed to be beyond imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to think of a greater mortification then this was for him, but yet inſtantly after followed that other, of his being hanged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that very gibbet which he had cauſed to be provided for <hi>Mardochaeus.</hi> This is the pay which the world is wont to give to ſuch as ſerve it.</p>
               <p>And now let us conſider, from whence al this cataſtrophe grew: Becauſe forſooth, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> would not riſe up, and do him reverence when he paſſed by. For ſuch a foolery as this, is able to keep proud men ſo unquiet, and reſtles, that they ſhall ever be wounded by it, and made ſad at the heart. And ſo we ſee it, at this day in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and ſo much more do we ſee it, as the men are in more eminent place. For al ſuch things as theſe, are as ſo many needles points to them, which gall, and tranſpeirce them from ſide to ſide, nor is there any ſharper launce which they can feel, nor do they ever want their part of this, how much ſoever
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170072:71"/>they are extolled, and whatſoever they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, but they ever have their hearts as bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as gall, and they ever walk up and down the World with perpetual unquietnes, and want of reſt.</p>
               <p>From hence we may underſtand, another particular which we experiment very often, namely, that although it be true, that there is a ſicknes of melancholy, yet many times it happens that a mans being melancholy and ſad, is not the humor of melancholy, or any corporal infirmitie, but it is the very humor of pride, which is a ſicknes of the ſoul. You are melancholy and ſad, becauſe you are forgotten and caſt aſide, into ſome corner, and becauſe they make no account of you. You are melancholy and ſad, becauſe you performed not ſuch or ſuch a thing with ſo much credit, and reputation, as you fancied to your ſelf; but rather you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that you are diſgraced. The buſines proved not as you deſired; that Sermon, that diſputation, thoſe concluſions; but you rather think that you have loſt opinion and credit by it, and therefore you are melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and ſad, yea and when you are to do any of theſe publique things, the-very fear of the ſucceſſe and whether you ſhal gain or looſe honour by it, makes you afflicted and greived. Theſe are ſome of thoſe things, which make the prond man melancholy, and ſad. But now the humble of heart, who
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170072:72"/>deſire no honour, or eſtimation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelf with a mean place, is free from all this reſtleſneſs, and diſquiet, and enjoyes great peace, according to the words of Chriſt our Lord, from whom that Saint took this ſaying of his. If there be peace in this World, the humble of heart poſſeſſes it. And therefore though there were no way of ſpirit or perfection to be looked after, but only our own intereſt, and the keeping our hearts in peace, and quietnes, even for this and this alone, we were to procure humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for thus we ſhould come to live, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other is but to lead a kind of dying life.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to this purpoſe recounts a certain thing of himſelf, whereby he ſaith, that our <hi>Lord</hi> gave him to underſtand the blindnes and miſery, wherein he was. As I went one day (ſaith he) full of affliction, and care in thought of a certain Oration which I was to recite before the Emperor, in his praiſe, whereof the greateſt part was to be falſe: and my ſelf procuring to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for my pains, even by them who knew that it would be falſe (that men may ſee how far the vanity, and folly, and madnes of the World, extends it ſelf) as I went I ſay with much thought hereof, and was full of trouble, and care, how the buſines might ſucceed, and having as it were even a kind of feaver upon me of conſuming thoughts, it
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170072:72"/>hapned, that in one of the ſtreets of <hi>Milan,</hi> there was a poor beggar, who after he had gotten wel to eat, and drink, was playing tricks, and taking his pleaſure, and in fine, was very merry and jolly. But when I ſaw this, I fel to ſigh, and repreſent to my friends who were preſent there, to what miſery our madnes hath made us ſubject. Since in all our troubles, and namely in thoſe wherein we found our ſelves at that time (carrying a great burthen of infelicity upon our backs, and being wounded with the vexation of a thouſand inordinate appetites, and daily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one burthen to another) we did not ſo much as procure to ſeek any other thing than only ſome ſecure kind of contentment, and joy, wherein that poor beggar had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripped us already, who perhaps ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to overtake him therein. For that, which he had now obtained by means of a little alms, namely the joy of temporal felicity, I ſtill went ſeeking, and hunting out with ſo much ſolicitude and care. It is true, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that the poor man had no true joy, but it is alſo true, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment which I ſought, was more falſe then this; and in fine he then was merry, and I ſaid, he was ſecure, and I ful of cares and fears. And if any man ſhould aſk me now, whether I had rather be glad or grieved, I ſhould quickly make anſwer, that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be glad; and if he ſhould aſk me yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170072:73"/>whether I had rather be that beggar, or my ſelf, I ſhould then rather chooſe to be my ſelf, though I were then ful of afflictions but yet for ought I know, I ſhould have no reaſon to make this choiſe. For I aſk what cauſe I can alledge. For my being more learned gave me then no contentment at all; but only deſired to give contentment to others, by my knowledge, and yet that, not by way of inſtructing them, but without doubt, (ſaith he) that poor man was more happy then I, not only becauſe he was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and jolly, when <hi>I</hi> was full of cogirations, and cares, which drew even my very bowels out of my body: but becauſe he had gotten his Wine by lawful means, whereas <hi>I</hi> was hunting after vain glory by the way of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling lies.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of another kind of means more efficatious for the obtaining the vertue of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, which is the exerciſe thereof.</head>
               <p>WE have already ſpoken of the firſt kind of means which are uſually aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the obtaining of vertue, which is, certain reaſons, and conſiderations, both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170072:73"/>and humane. But yet the inclination which we have to this vice of pride is ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, by reaſon that the deſire of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>(Eritis ſicut dii)</hi> remains ſo rooted in our hearts from our firſt parents; that no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations at all, are ſufficient to make us take our laſt leave, of the impulſe and edge which we have to be honored, and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, It ſeems that that happens to us herein, which ours to others who are full of fear. For how many reaſons ſoever you give to perſwade ſuch perſons, that they have no cauſe to fear ſuch or ſuch a thing, they yet make this anſwer, <hi>I</hi> ſee well that all you ſay is true, and <hi>I</hi> would fain not fear, but yet <hi>I</hi> cannot obtain it of my ſelf. For juſt ſo, ſome ſay in our caſe, <hi>I</hi> well perceive that al thoſe reaſons which you have brought againſt the opinion and eſtimation of the World, are good &amp; true, &amp; they convince that all is but meer vanity and Wind, but yet with all this, I cannot by any means Win ſo much of my ſelf, as not to make ſome account thereof. <hi>I</hi> would fain do it if <hi>I</hi> could, but me thinks <hi>I</hi> know not how thoſe kind of things, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and diſquiers me ſtrangely. Wel then, as no reaſons and conſiderations, are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to free the fearful man from fear, but that beſides this, we muſt entreat him to put his hand to work, and bid him draw neer, to feel, &amp; touch thoſe things, which ſeemed to him to be bugbears &amp; ſprights; &amp; adviſe him
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170072:74"/>to go ſometime by night, and alone to the ſame places where he thought he ſaw them, that ſo he might find by experience, that there was nothing indeed, but that all was his imagination, and apprehenſion, that ſo by this means he may looſe his fear: ſo alſo for the making us give over the deſire of opinion, and eſtimation of the World, the Saints affirm, that no reaſons or conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſufficient: but that we muſt alſo uſe the means of action, and of the exerciſe of <hi>Humility,</hi> for this is the principal, and moſt efficatious means, which we for our parts, can imploy, towards the obtaining of this vertue.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, that as Sciences and arts are acquired by practiſe, ſo alſo are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertues. That a man may be a good Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, a good Rethorition, a good Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and a good Workman in any kind, let him exerciſe himſelf herein, and he wil grow perfect. And ſo alſo, for obtaining the habit of <hi>Humility,</hi> and all the reſt of the moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, we muſt exerciſe our ſelves in the acts thereof, and by this means we ſhall poſſeſſe them. And if any man will tell me, that for the compoſing and moderating our paſſions, and the affections of the mind, and for the obtaining alſo of vertue, the conſiderations, and reaſons, the documents, and counſels of holy Scripture are ſufficient, he is deceived as Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith. This would be like him
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170072:74"/>who ſhould learn to build a houſe, or coyn money, and would never exerciſe himſelf therein, but that all ſhould paſſe in hearing the documents, and rules of art, in which caſe it is certain, that he would never prove a good Workman. And as little will he grow to poſſeſſe <hi>humility,</hi> or any other vertue, who will not exerciſe himſelf therein. And in confirmation hereof, the Saint brings that of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul. For not the hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified. Rom:</hi> 2.13. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for this purpoſe to hear many docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and reaſons, but they muſt be put in execution. For practiſe conduces more to this buſines then all the ſpeculation in the World. And though it be moſt true, that al vertue, and every thing which is good, muſt come to us from the hand of God, and that we cannot compaſſe it by our own ſtrength; yet the ſame <hi>Lord</hi> who is to give it, is pleaſed that we ſhould help our ſelves, by our own endeavours.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon thoſe words of Chriſt our Lord. <hi>If I then your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers feet, Joh:</hi> 13.14. ſaith that this is that, which Chriſt our Lord intended to teach us by this example of waſhing his Diſciples feet: This is that O bleſſed <hi>Peter,</hi> which thou didſt not know when thou wouldſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that Chriſt ſhould waſh thy feet. He
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170072:75"/>promiſed that thou ſhouldſt know it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and now, that afterward is come, and now thou ſhalt underſtand it. And it is, that if we will obtain the vertue of <hi>humility,</hi> we muſt exerciſe our ſelves in the exterior acts thereof. For I have given you an example, to the end that you may do as I have done. Since the omnipotent, and ſoveraign Lord humbled himſelf: ſince the Son of God aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and imployed himſelf in mean, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſes, waſhing the feet of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſerving his bleſſed Mother, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and being ſubject and obedient to them in whatſoever they commanded; let us learn of them, and exerciſe our ſelves in humble and mean imployments, and thus we ſhall come to obtain the vertue of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. This is alſo that which Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith. The humiliation of the extericur man, is the way and means, to obtain the vertue of Humility; as patience is, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining peace, and reading or ſtudy for the obtaining knowledge. And therefore if you will obtain the vertue of Humility donot fly from the exerciſe of humiliation: for if you ſay, that either you cannot, or will not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or abaſe your ſelves, as little have you a mind to obtain the vertue of <hi>humility</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> proves it very wel, &amp; gives the reaſon, why this exerciſe of humiliation, is ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, important, and neceſſary, for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of true humility of heart. The interiour
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170072:75"/>and exteriour man are ſo interlaced and united together, and the one depends ſo much upon the other, that when the heart is humbled and abaſed, the heart is ſtirred up towards the love of <hi>humility.</hi> That hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling my ſelf before my Brother, and kiſſing his feet, hath ſomewhat in it; that poor and mean coat, that low and baſe Office, hath I know not what, which goes ingenering, and breeding Humility in the heart, and if it be there already, it conſerves and increaſes it. And thus Saint <hi>Dorotheus</hi> anſwers this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, how a man with a poor and mean coat, which belongs to the body, may come to obtain the vertue of humility, which inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits the ſoul? It is certain ſaith he, that the body in many caſes, gives a good, or ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the ſoul. And ſo we ſee the ſoul hath one kind of diſpoſition, when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is well, and another when it is ſick, one when it is full fed, and another when it is very hungry. Now in the ſelf ſame manner, the ſoul veſts it ſelf with one kind of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, when a man is ſeated upon a throne, or upon a Horſe richly adorned, and with another, when he ſits upon the ground, or is riding upon a jade; and one kind of inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it hath, when he is ſet out in ſumptuous cloaths, and another when he is but covered with a poor coat.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> alſo noted this very well; and ſaith, that as a gallant and ſhining attire,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170072:76"/>liſts up the hearts of Worldly men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders in them, certain ſumes of vanity of proper eſtimation and pride, ſo doth a poor and mean habit awake in the heart of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and of the ſervants of God, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to <hi>Humility,</hi> and it breeds a diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of ones ſelf; and it makes men endure better, to be deſpiſed. And the Saint adds further, That as Worldly men deſire rich, and glorious cloaths, that ſo they may be the better known, and the more honored, and eſteemed thereby; ſo the good ſervants of God, and ſuch as are truly humble, deſire to be poor and meanly clad, that ſo they may be valued the leſle: and eſpecially becauſe they conceive themſelves to find much help therein, towards the conſervation, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in true <hi>humility.</hi> Amongſt all the exteriour humiliations, that of poor and mean cloathing is one of the chief, and for this, we find it to have been ſo much uſed, by ſuch as are truly humble.</p>
               <p>It will alſo appear by another reaſon, that towards the purchaſe of <hi>humility</hi> of heart, or any other interiour vertue, the exteriour exerciſe of the ſame vertue doth profit much, becauſe the vvil is much more moved thereby, then by bare deſires. For it is cleer that preſent object moves us more, then the abſent, as vve ſee that vve are moved more by ſeeing things, then by hearing of them; and from hence the Proverb came, <hi>That
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170072:76"/>which the eyes ſee not, the heart rues not.</hi> So that the exteriour thing vvhich is put in practiſe moves the vvill much more, becauſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is there preſent, then meer apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and interiour deſires do, vvhere the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is not preſent, but only in the conceit and imagination. One great affront vvel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured with a good Will, ſhall breed more of the vertue of patience in your ſoul, then four affronts will do, when you have but the only deſire without the deed. And the ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of one day in exerciſing ſome mean and low Office, and the wearing ſome poor and mean apparel, ſome one day, will help your ſoul more to the vertue of <hi>Humility,</hi> then many days of meer deſires will do. We have experience every day, that a man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance to perform one of the ordinary mortifications which we uſe; and within two or three dayes after he hath begun to do them, he finds no difficulty therein at all, and yet before he did them, he had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many purpoſes, and deſires thereof, and yet ſtill they were not ſtrong enough to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the difficulty, And to this we may add, that which is ſaid by the <hi>School Divines,</hi> that when the interiour act is accompanied by the exteriour, it is commonly more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious and intenſe. So that, it helps much in all reſpects, towards the obtaining of the vertue of humility, to imploy our ſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly about objects which are mean and baſe.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:170072:77"/>
               <p>And becauſe vertue is conſerved, and augmented by the ſame means, whereby it is obtained, therefore as the exteriour exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Humility is neceſſary for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vertue of <hi>Humility,</hi> it will alſo be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the cuſtody and increaſe thereof; whereupon it will follow, that this exerciſe is very important for all, not only for begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but for others alſo, who are great profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, as we alſo ſaid when we were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mortification. For it is a good rule that is given by one in theſe words. It will greatly help that We perform thoſe offices with all poſſible devotion, wherein Humility and charity are exerciſed moſt. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he ſaith. Temptations are to be prevented by their contraries, as when there is opinion, that ſuch a one is inclined to pride, he muſt be exerciſed in ſuch mean things, as may be likely to help him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Humility,</hi> and ſo in other ill inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And yet in another place. As for mean and baſe imployments, men ought readily to accept of thoſe wherein they find moſt repugnance, whenſoever they ſhall be ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. So that finally I ſay, that theſe two things, Humility, and Humiliation muſt help one another, and from the interiour humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which conſiſts in deſpiſing himſelf, and deſiring to be held by others in ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, exteriour humiliation is to grow, that the man may exteriourly ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170072:77"/>to be the ſame, that interiourly he took himſelf to be. Namely, that as the humble man is interiourly contemptible in his own eyes, and holds himſelf to be unworthy of all honor, ſo he muſt treat himſelf alſo exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly; that the exteriour works which he performs, may viſibly declare the interiour <hi>humility,</hi> which is in his heart. Chooſe you the loweſt place, as Chriſt our <hi>Lord</hi> adviſed; deſpiſe not to treat with Perſons who are poor, and mean, be glad of the moſt inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our imployments; and this very exteriour humiliation which ſprings from the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, will give increaſe to that very Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain alſo, from which it ſprings.</p>

Never ſuffer pride to have dominion either over thy heart, or over
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170072:78"/>thy words. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ponders that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> very well to this purpoſe. <hi>But now I forbear, leſt any man ſhould think of me above that which he ſeeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</hi> The Apoſtle had formerly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken great things of humſelf, and ſo it was fit at that time that he ſhould do, for the good of hearers, and for the greater glory of God; and he might yet have ſaid greater things ſince he had been rapt up into the third Heaven, where he had ſeen, and underſtood more, then the tongue could ſpeak, but <hi>I</hi> forbear ſaith he, to ſpeak thereof, leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe any man ſhould think more then he ſees, and hears of me.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, O how well he ſaid. I forbear that for this time. The proud or arrogant man, forbears not ſuch things, for he ſuffers no occaſion to paſſe, wherein he may magnifie himſelf: yea, and ſometimes he adds, and ſaith more then is, that ſo he may be eſteemed the more. Onely the man who is truly humble, lets theſe occaſions paſſe: and to the end he may be ſure, that they ſhal not aſcribe more to him, then that which is true, he conceals that which is true. The Saint deſcends more particularly into this ſubject, and ſaith: you muſt not ſay any thing, whereby you may ſeem more learned, or to be a man of piety, &amp; prayer. And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, you muſt take heed of ſaying any thing, which may redound in any kind, to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170072:78"/>your own praiſe, for it is very dangerous, though you could ſay it with much truth, and though it may be matter of edification, and though you may think it to be a good end, and for the profit of another, yet it ſuffices that it is to your own praiſe, to keep you from ſpeaking it. You muſt ever walk with great care concerning this, leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by this means, you looſe the good which perhaps you did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boniventure</hi> ſaith, you muſt never ſpeak Word which may give others to underſtand that you have eminent parts, or that you were formerly of ſome account in the World. It looks very ill favouredly in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, to value himſelf by the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and riches of his friends, for all theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrees, and ſtates, are no better then a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wind: and as one aſked, do you know for what Nobility is good? the other anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very vvell, To be deſpiſed, as Wealth is. <hi>Saint Baſil</hi> ſaith, he vvho is born by another nevv birth, and hath contracted a ſpiritual, and divine kindred vvith God, and received a power to become his Son, grows aſhamed of that other carnal kindred, and layes it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly aſide. Whoſoever the man be, Words of praiſe, ſound ill out of his own mouth. And ſo the Proverb ſaith. <hi>A mans praiſe in his own mouth is little worth. Prov:</hi> 27.2. And the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſaith better. <hi>Let another man praiſe thee, and not thine own mouth: a ſtranger
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170072:79"/>and not thine own lips.</hi> But in the mouth of a religious man, they do much worſe, as being ſo contrary to that which he profeſſes, and ſo be grows to be ſlightly thought of; and diſeſteemed by means of that very thing, whereby he meant to be honored. <hi>Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> upon thoſe words of the <hi>Prophet. Behold O Lord, my humility, and deliver me,</hi> ſaith, that although a man be ſick, and poor, and of mean condition, yet if he grow not proud not prefer himſelf before any other, By <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> he makes himſelf to be eſteemed, and beloved. So that <hi>humility</hi> ſupplies all defects; and on the other ſide, though a man be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich, and noble, and powerful: though he be very learned, and excell in abilities, and good parts, yet if withall, he boaſt thereof, and look big upon it. By this, he leſſons and abaſes himſelf, and grows to be diſeſteemed, and deſpiſed, becauſe he grows to be held proud.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of devout Arſenius recounts, that although he had been ſo illuſtrious in the World, and ſo eminent in learning, for he had been the inſtructer, or Maſter, of the Sons of the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> who alſo came both to be Emperors, yet no word was ever heard to fall from him, which might favour of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or which gave to underſtand, that he had learning, but he converſt, and lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Brethren, with ſo great <hi>humility,</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:170072:79"/>and ſimplicity of heart, as if he had never known any thing; and he would alſo aſk queſtions of others, concerning the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary things of ſpiritual life, affirming that in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Bonaventure</hi> gives a very good reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this vanity, and it is this. Know that there can hardly be any good thing in you, worthy of praiſe, which breaks not, and ſhines not out to others, ſo that they may underſtand, and know it; and if you uſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and conceal it, you ſhall gain more upon them, and be more worthy of praiſe, both for the vertue it ſelf, and for your hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; but if you will needs become the publiſher thereof, and will needs ſerve it out in a full diſh, they will make ſport at it; And whereas before they were edified, and you eſteemed, they now grow to vilifie, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe you. Vertue is in this, like musk, which the more you hide it, the ſtronger ſmell it gives, but if you carry it open, it looſes his ſent.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> In what manner we are to make a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular examination of our conſciences, concerning the vertue of Humility.</head>
               <p>THe particular examination, as we have ſaid already in the proper place, is to be of ſome one only thing: for thus will this means be more efficatious, and have greater force then if we carried o're many things together, and it is therefore called particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar becauſe it concerns one only thing. And this is of ſo great importance, that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is neceſſary to take many times one vice, which we would avoid, and one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which we would obtain, into parts, that ſo, by little and little, we may be able to compaſſe that which we deſire. So is it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this vertue. If you will make your particular examination, about rooting up the pride of your heart, and of obtaining the vertue of Humility, you muſt not take it in hand, after a kind of general way. For <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and pride, imbrace many particulars, and if you take it but ſo in groſſe, as to ſay I will be proud in nothing, but humble in all things, it is too much to examine your
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170072:80"/>ſelves upon, at once, and it will be more, if you do it upon two or three vertues at once and thu, in fine you will do nothing. But you are to take it into parts, and to go on by little and little Conſider in what you are chiefly wont to ſail, concerning <hi>Humility,</hi> or in exerciſing of pride, and begin there, and having ended with one particular thing, take another to heart, and then another, and thus by little and little, you will go rooting up the whole vice of pride out of your ſouls, and planting the vertue of Humility in place thereof. Let us therefore now go part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dividing theſe things, that ſo you may the better, and with the more profit, make this particular examination, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this vertue which is ſo neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſhall be not to ſpeak a word which may redound to our own eſtimation and praiſe. For the appetite of honour and eſtimation, is ſo natural to us, and we carry it ſo rooted in our hearts: that, even as it were without thinking, or reflecting upon it, our tongues tun voluntarily to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which either directly, or indirectly may redound to our own praiſe. The mouth is wont to ſpeak, out of the abundance of the heart. As ſoon as any occaſion is offered, whereby honour may be gained, we inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come in for our parts: as by ſaying, I was in place; I was partly the cauſe: If I had been abſent. I was intereſſed in that from the beginning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:170072:81"/>
               <p>And the while, <hi>I</hi> dare warrant you that if the thing had not brought honour with it, you would have been content, to hold your peace, though you had been preſent, yea and partly had been the cauſe thereof. Of this kind, there are other words, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times we obſerve not, till they be paſt: and therefore it will be very well done, to make a particular examination upon this point: that ſo by care, and good cuſtome, we may take away this other ill one, which is ſo connatural to us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond may be that, which Saint <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> adviſes us; namely, that we be nor willing to hear any other praiſe, or ſpeak well of us, for in this, there is alſo great danger. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, that when the divel cannot beat us down by puſillanimitie, and diſmay, he procures to blow us up by preſumption and pride, and when he cannot overthrow us, by the way of affronts, he procures that we may be honoured and praiſed, and ſo to be undone by that means. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, Keep your ſelves ſafe from theſe Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens, for they inchant men, and put them out of their wits. The muſick of the praiſes of men, is ſo delightful and ſo ſweet to our ears, that there are no Syrens, which can ſo inchant men, nor put them ſo out of their Wits, and therefore we had need to ſtop our ears, and make our ſelves deaf to them. Saint <hi>John Climacus</hi> adviſes us, when men praiſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170072:81"/>us, to call our ſins to mind, for ſo ſhall we find our ſelves to be unworthy of the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they give, and ſo ſhall we draw more Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and confuſion from thence. This may therefore be the ſecond thing, upon which you may particularly examine your ſelves: Namely, that you rejoyce not to be well ſpoken of, and praiſed by others. And to this we may alſo joyn, the being glad when others are well ſpoken of, and praiſed, which is a point of very great importance. And whenſoever you find either any feeling or motion of envy for the praiſe of others, or elſe of any complacence or vain content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that others ſpeak well of you; be ſure to ſet it down for a fault.</p>
               <p>The third thing upon which we may make a particular examination of our ſelves, is concerning the not doing of any thing, to the end that we may be ſeen, or eſteemed by men. And this is that, which Chriſt our Lord adviſes us, in the holy Goſpel. Mat: 6.1. <hi>Take heed that ye do not your alms,</hi> (or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes as ſome copies have it) <hi>before men, to be ſeen of them, otherwiſe ye have no reward of your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> This is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable examination, &amp; it may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into many parts. Firſt it may be made, upon the not doing of any thing for humane reſpects. Secondly, upon the doing things meerly for the love of God. And thirdly, upon the doing them perfectly well, as one
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170072:82"/>who doth them in the preſence of God, and as one who ſerves not men but God. And this diligence is to be uſed by us, till the works be performed by us in ſuch ſort, as we may rather ſeem to be loving God in them, then to be working of them.</p>
               <p>The fourth point upon, which we may carry our particular examination, is not to excuſe our ſelves. For this alſo grows from pride, when committing a fault, and being told of it, we inſtantly make our excuſe, and without even marking it, we make one excuſe ſometimes upon another, yea and we will yet give another excuſe, for having formerly excuſed our ſelves, Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> up on theſe words of <hi>Job, If as a man, I have hidden my ſin,</hi> ponders theſe words very wel: <hi>Quaſi homo</hi> as a man, and ſaith: that it is the property of a man, to deſire to cover, and excuſe his ſin, becauſe it comes to us by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, from our firſt parents. As ſoon as the firſt man had ſinned, he went inſtantly to hide himſelf amongſt the trees of Paradiſe, and God reproving him for his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he thus excuſed himſelf preſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wife, <hi>O Lord, that Woman, whom thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me for my companion, made me eat of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit.</hi> And the Woman excuſed her ſelf in like manner, upon the Serpent. <hi>The Serpent deceived me, and I did eat thereof.</hi> God examined them about their ſin, to the end that knowing it, and confeſſing it, they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170072:82"/>might obtain pardon for it: and ſo Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, that he did not examine the Serpent, becauſe he meant not to pardon the ſerpent. But they, inſtead of humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and acknowledging their ſin, towards the obtaining of pardon, increaſe and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it, by their excuſes: yea and by deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, after a ſort, thus to caſt the fault upon God. The Woman whom thou gaveſt me O Lord, was the cauſe. As if he had ſaid; If thou hadſt not given her me for a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no part of this had been done. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent which thou didſt create, and ſuffer to enter into Paradiſe, deceived me, and if thou hadſt not ſuffered it to enter there, I had not ſinned, <hi>S. Greg:</hi> ſaith, that they having heard from the Devils mouth, that they ſhould be like God, ſince they could not become like him in the point of his Divinity, they endeavoured to make him like them, in the point of their ſin; and ſo they made it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by defending it, then they had done by committing it. And now, as being children of ſuch parents, and in fine, as being men, we ſtill remain with this infirmity, and with this defect, and ill cuſtome, and when we are reproved for any ſault, we inſtantly have a mind to cover it with an excuſe, as under bows and leaves: yea and ſometimes, a man is not content to excuſe himſelf, but he muſt needs be caſting the fault upon others. One compares ſuch as excuſe themſelves to he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170072:83"/>Hedg-hoge, which when ſhe perceives that they go about to take her, ſhe ſhrinks in her head and feet with extreme ſpeed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains as a boul, being circled on every ſide, as it were with thorns; ſo that a man cannot touch her, without pricking himſelf firſt. So that you ſhall ſooner ſee your own blood, then her body. In this manner ſaith he, be they who are wont to excuſe themſelves; for if you will but touch them, by telling them the faults which they made, they inſtantly defend themſelves, like the hedg-hog, &amp; ſom times they prick &amp; gaul you, &amp; give you alſo to underſtand, that you as well deſerve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. At other times, they wil be telling you, that there is a rule, which forbids one to find fault with another, and that there be ſome who make greater faults, which yet men are content to diſſemble; and in fine, do but touch the hedg-hogg, and you ſhall ee whether he will prick you or no. Al this buſines grows from our great pride, who would not have our faults known, nor be held for defective, and it troubles us more, that they be underſtood and for the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we think we looſe thereby, then for having committed them; and ſo we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to conceal and hide them, the moſt we can. Nay there are ſome ſo unmortified in this kind, that even before you ſay any thing, they prevent you, and excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and give reaſons for that which they
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170072:83"/>think you may object; and they ſay, If I did this, it was for this reaſon, and if I did that, it was for that: and the like. But who in the mean time pricks you now, that you muſt ſkip ſo high. The goad of pride it is, which you carry ſo deeply rooted in your hearts. This is that which pricks you, and which makes you leap even before your time. It will therefore be well done by him who finds this old and ill cuſtome in himſelf, to examine himſelf particularly thereof; till at length, he may come to part with all deſire of covering his faults, but rather ſince he committed them, let him be glad to be held faulty, in ſhame and puniſhment thereof, yea and though you have made no fault, and yet they reprehend you as if you had, yet do not you alwayes excuſe your ſelves.</p>
               <p>The fifth, is alſo very good for a man to examine himſelf upon, namely, the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cutting of all thoughts of pride. A man is ſo proud and vain, that many idle, and preſumptuous thoughts, will be ruſhing in upon him, and he will imagine himſelf to be in ſome high Office, and performing of ſome great function. Already you fancy your ſelves to be preaching in the places where you were born, with great allowance, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and you imagine that you produce great fruit. Already do you conceive that you are reading, or diſputing againſt ſuch concluſions, with great applauſe of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170072:84"/>and ſuch things as theſe. All this grows from our great pride, which lyes ſprouting, and breaking out into theſe thoughts. And therefore it will be very well done, to make a particular examination upon the clipping, and cutting of theſe thoughts, which are ſo haughty and vain. And ſo will it be fit ſo to ſtop, and inſtantly to cut off all impure thoughts, and raſh judgments, or any other vice, whereby we may find our ſelves to be moleſted.</p>
               <p>The ſixt point ſhall be, to carry a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examination upon your ſelves, whether you eſteem of all men as your. Superiors. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that rule, that we muſt animate our ſelves towards Humility, by procuring, and deſiring to give the advantage to others, eſteeming them all from our very ſouls, as if they were our ſuperiours, and exteriourly bearing them that reſpect, and reverence, which the condition, or ſtate of every one of them ſhall bear with plainnes, and religious ſimplicity of heart: and this is alſo taken from the Apoſtle. And howſoever there is to be a difference amongſt men, according to the diſtinction of their perſons, and ſtates, yet for as much as may concern the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and true Humility of our ſouls, every one of us muſt hold himſelf for the leaſt, and loweſt, and muſt hold all others for his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and betters. This ſhal therefore be a very good, and profitable examination: but
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170072:84"/>yet ſo, as that it be not only ſpeculative, but that in the exerciſe, and practiſe thereof, we procure to carry our ſelves ſo towards all, with ſuch Humility, and reſpect, as if they were indeed our ſuperiours. For if you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem that other man as your ſuperior, you will not be talking to him with ſuch liberty and harſhnes, and much leſs in words, which may mortifie, and offend him, nor will you ſo eaſily paſſe your judgment raſhly upon him, nor be diſguſted that he ſhould treat you; or ſpeak to you in this or that manner, and ſo you are to ſet down, and note al theſe things for faults, when you examine your ſelf thereupon.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh thing whereof we may parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly examine our ſelves, upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is whether we make good uſe of all thoſe occaſions which offer themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the getting of <hi>Humility.</hi> Are you wont to be troubled when another ſpeaks ſome little word to you, which you would not hear, or when they command any things in too reſolute, and imperious manner, or when you think they make not ſo much account of you as of others? Examine your ſelves whether you make good uſe of theſe, as alſo thoſe other occaſions, which ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent themſelves redounding to your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimation. This is one of the moſt proper, and moſt profitable examinations, which we can uſe towards the obtaining of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170072:85"/>of <hi>Humility.</hi> For beſides that, we ſhal thus go providing our ſelves, for all thoſe things which may daily occurre, and whereof we may ſtand in need; we may, by means of this examination, go encreaſing, and riſing up by thoſe three degrees of vertue, which we ſet down before. Firſt, you may examine whether or no you carry all theſe things with patience. Secondly, whether you car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them with ſo much promptitude and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, as that they put you to no trouble. And thirdly, whether you carry them with joy, &amp; with taking pleaſure in the contempt of your ſelf, for in this we ſhewed before, that the perfection of <hi>humility</hi> doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>The eighth point upon which a man may particularly examine himſelf, either in this ſubject, or tohers like it, is to make ſome acts or exerciſes, as wel interiour as exteriour of <hi>humility,</hi> or any other vertue, about which he examines himſelf, meditating upon it, ſo many times in the morning, and ſo many in the evening beginning with fewer acts, and ſo riſing up to more, till at length he get the habit and cuſtome of that vertue. And now the enemies being divided after this manner and we taking every one of them by himſelf they will the more eaſily be overcome, and the victory which is deſired, will be the more ſpeedily obtained.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP: XXV.</hi> How it may be compatible with Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be willing to be accounted of, and eſteemed by men.</head>
               <p>THere is a doubt, wont to be propounded concerning Humility, the ſolution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth much import, that ſo we may know how to carry, and conduct our ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. We ordinarily ſay, and it is the general Doctrine of the Saints, that we muſt deſire to be abaſed, diſeſteemed, and deſpiſed, that men may hold us in no account. But then inſtantly it comes to be conſidered on the other ſide, how we ſhall be able to gather fruit, by the good of our Neighbors, if they difeſteem, and deſpiſe us: for to that end it is neceſſary, that we have a kind of credit with them, and that they may hold us in good opinion and eſtimation: &amp; therefore it may ſeem, that it ſhall not be ill, but good that we deſire to be valued, and eſteemed by men. Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> treat upon this doubt very wel, and ſay, that although it be true, that we muſt fly from the honour, and eſtimation of the World, by reaſon of the great danger which is therein, and that, for as much as is on our part, and for that which may concern our
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170072:86"/>ſelves, we muſt ever deſire to be diſeſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and deſpiſed, yet for ſome good end of the greater ſervice of God, the honour and eſtimation of the World, may lawfully, and piouſly be deſired. And Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith alſo, that for as much as concerns our part, we muſt wiſh that men may think, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of us, as we think and eſteem of our ſelves, that ſo they may value us as our ſelves do, but yet he ſaith withall, that it is not fit many times, that others ſhould be ſure thereof, and ſo therefore that we may ſometimes even lawfully, and vertuouſly procure that they may not know our faults, leſt ſo themſelves may receive hurt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, through the hindrance of their own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good. But in the mean time, it will be neceſſary that we underſtand this point ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, and that we walk therein, with great caution, and with much ſpirit, becauſe ſuch truths as this, inſteed of doing good, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times much hurt to ſome, who know not how to make right uſe thereof. The Saints themſelves declare this Doctrine very well, that ſo we may not take occaſion of errour from thence. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, even holy men are glad that they have good opinion, and eſtimation amongſt men; but this happens when they find that it is a neceſſary means, for the doing good, and giving help to their Neighbours ſouls, And this (ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>) is not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170072:86"/>at his own credit or eſtimation, but for the fruit and good of his Neighbours; Which is a very different caſe. It is one thing for a man to love humane honour, and eſtimation for it ſelf, and to dwell as it were therein, for his own reſpect, and contentment, that ſo he may grow great, and be celebrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, and this is naught; but another thing it is, when this is liked for ſome good end, as for the good of our Neighbours, and to give help to ſouls, and this is not ill but good, and thus we may well deſire opinion, and eſtimation of the World, and that they may have us in good conceir, for the greater glory of God, and becauſe it may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the edification of our Neighbours and for the benefit of their ſouls. For thus a man ſhall not rejoyce in his own honour, and eſtimation, but in the ſpiritual good of others, and the greater glory of Almighty God. And as he who for his health deſires to take a purge, which he naturally abhors, may well ſay, that to admit and like the purge, is to love his health, ſo he who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and likes humane honour, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he deſpiſes, (only becauſe in that caſe it is a neceſſary, or at leaſt a profitable means for the ſervice of God, and the good of ſouls) may affirm with truth, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and likes nothing in it, but the glory of Almighty God.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:170072:87"/>
               <p>But let us now conſider, how we may know whether a man delight in honour and eſtimation, for the meer glory of God, and the good of his Neigbours, or elſe for his own ſake, and for the affection which he bears to his own honour: for this indeed is a nice point, wherein the whole difficulty of this buſines conſiſts. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> anſwered thus: Our being glad of honour and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to be ſo meerly for God, that when it is not neceſſary for his greater glory, and the good of ſouls, not only we are not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joce therein, but to be troubled at it. So that our deſire and heart, for as much as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on us, is ever to be inclined to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and contempt; and therefore when any occaſion thereof is preſented, we muſt embrace it with our whole hearts, and be glad of it as men, who have met with what they wiſhed for. And as for honour and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, we are only to deſire it, and be glad thereof, ſo far forth as it may be neceſſary for the edification, and further good of our Neighbours ſouls, and for the greater honor, and glory of Almighty God. By this you ſhall therefore know, if you be glad of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and eſtimation, for the good of ſouls, and the glory of God, or elſe for your own honour and ſame: If when any occaſion of humility, and contempt is offered, you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it in good earneſt, and with the heart; and if you rejoyce thereat, it is then a good
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170072:88"/>ſigne; that when ſuch a Sermon, or ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imployment hath ſucceeded well, and that you are valued and eſteemed for it, you rejoyce not for your own honour, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but meerly for the glory of God, and the good of ſouls which grows thereby. But when on the other ſide ſome occaſion of <hi>humility,</hi> and of being held in ſmal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is offered, you reject it, or you carry it not well; and if when it is not neceſſary for the good of others, you will yet be glad of eſtimation, and praiſe of men, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure alſo to have it, this indeed is a ſigne, that you are glad alſo in thoſe other things, as for a thing which hath relation to your ſelf, and your own eſtimation and honor, and not meerly for the glory of God, and the good of ſouls.</p>
               <p>So that it is true, that the honour and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of men, is not ill but good, if we uſe it rightly, and it may lawfully, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be deſired. Yea even a mans praiſing himſelf, may be holy and good, if it be done as it ought. And ſo we ſee that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to them of <hi>Corinthus,</hi> began to praiſe and recount great things of himſelf, relating the high favours which our Lord had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to him, and ſaying; That he had labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more then the reſt of the Apoſtles: yea, and he began to tell them of his Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and rapture, whereby he had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up to the third Heaven. But all this he
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170072:89"/>did, becauſe it was convenient, yea and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the glory of God, and good of them to whom he wrote, that ſo they might grow to hold, and value him for an Apoſtle of Chriſt, and embrace his Doctrine, and take benefit thereby: and he ſpoke theſe things of himſelf, with a heart, which did not only deſpiſe honour, but love diſhonor for the love of Chriſt our <hi>Lord,</hi> and when his honour was not neceſſary for the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he knew very well how to empty and abaſe himſelf, ſaying. That he was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe he had perſecuted the Church of God, and ſtiling himſelf blaſphemous, and abortive, and the greateſt of ſinners; and when the occaſions of diſhonour, and contempt were preſented to him, therein was his contentment, and joy. Such hearts as theſe, we may well truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with receiving honour, and with ſaying ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch things as may conduce towards it; becauſe they will never do it, but when it may be neceſſary for the greater glory of God, yea and even then, they do it ſo much without the ſticking of any part, thereof to themſelves, as if they had not done it at all: for they love not their own honour, but the honour of Almighty God, and the good of ſouls.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it is a matter of much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, to receive honour, and not to grow proud by it, nor to take any vain content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170072:89"/>or complaſence therein: therefore the Saints through their fear of the great danger which lurks in eſtimation, and dignity, and high place, fled as far as they could from it, and they procured to buſie themſelves in mean, and contemptible imployments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw that they profited thereby in Humility, which was the moſt ſecure way for them. One ſaid very well, I am not a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, if I take not diſhonour, with the ſame both inward and outward joy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I take honour. For if I joy in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which others allow me, when I preach, or perform any other office of charity to them, for their good, (whereby yet I put my ſoul to run ſome hazard, through the danger of vanity) much more ought I joy in mine own good, and in the ſalvation of mine own ſoul, which I preſerve with more ſecurity, when I am ſcorned; and it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that we are more obliged to joy in our own good, and profit, then in that of others, becauſe charity wel ordered begins at home. If then you joy in the good of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, when the ſermon, or other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath ſucceeded wel, and when you are eſteemed, and praiſed for it, why ſhould you not be glad of your own good, when you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done what was in you, are yet underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued for your pain, for this is better, and more ſafe for you? If you be glad when you have a great talent, wherewith to do great
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170072:90"/>things, for the good of others, why are yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not glad of your own good, and for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left in contempt, becauſe God gave you no ſuch talent? If you be glad when you have much health, and ſtrength, wherewith to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hard for the good of others, why ſhould you not be glad; when God is pleaſed that you ſhould be ſick, and weak, and be fit for nothing, but to be laid in a corner, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſe: for this is your profit, and this will help you more towards <hi>humility,</hi> and in this ſhall you pleaſe God more, then if you were a great Preacher, or a Wiſe, &amp; active Stateſ. man, ſince his Wil is ſo.</p>
               <p>Hereby it may be ſeen, how much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they are, who have lodged their eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on honour, and the eſtimation of the World under colour, forſooth, that is neceſſary for the doing good to others: and under this pretence, they deſire high place, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable imployments, and all that which looks like greatnes: and ſo they fly from all that which is mean and poor: for they make themſelves beleeve, that they were to be diſauthoriſed thereby. But in this is another deceit, and a very great one, that by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, whereby a man pretends to gain authority, he looſeth it, and by that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he thought to looſe it, he ſhal gain it.</p>
               <p>But now laying this laſt reaſon, vvhich is the chief aſide, and to conſider the thing in queſtion, by the vvay of prudence, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170072:91"/>reaſon, you cannot employ a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatious means to gain authority, and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt your Neighbours, and to do good to ſouls, then to exerciſe your ſelves in theſe things which ſeem poor and baſe, (ſuch as are, to Catechnize Children in a low way of ſhort queſtions, and anſwers, to teach, or to ſee them taught the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of good Religion, and manners, daily to viſit the ſick, the poor and ignorant, and humbly, and kindly to inſtruct, comfort, and quicken them, as occaſion is offered.) And to do theſe things ſo much the more, by hovv much the more your parts are greater. The reaſon of this is, becauſe the World doth ſo hugely eſteem of honor, and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of things vvhich are high, in order to that end, as that the thing of the vvhole World, vvhich it admires moſt, is the man vvho deſpiſes that, and to ſee that one vvho might be uſed in high and honourable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, doth chooſe to paſſe his hours, in things that are poor and mean: and thus they grow to frame a great conceit, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſauctity of ſuch Perſons, and accept of that Doctrine vvhich they teach, as if it came immediately to them from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>This is that kind of Authority, vvhereof men have need, that ſo they may be able to do good to ſouls: this is the eſtimation and opinion, vvhich follows humble men, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170072:92"/>belongs to Saints, and Evangelical Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and this in a word, is that which we are to procure. For as for thoſe other Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and reputations, and punctilios, which carry a ſmack, and ſavour of the World with them, they do great hurt, and they diſedifie our Neighbours very much.</p>
               <p>Upon thoſe words of Saint <hi>John, I ſeek not mine own glory; there is one that ſeeketh, and judgeth. John</hi> 8.50. A Doctor ſaith thus very well: Since our Heavenly Father procures, and ſeeks our honor, and our glory, our ſelves have no need to take care thereof. Take you care to humble your ſelves, and to be ſuch as you ought, and as for any ſuch eſtimation and authority, whereof you think you may have need, for the good of ſouls, leave you that to God, for even wherby you ſhall moſt humble and abaſe your ſelves, thereby will God raiſe you moſt, and indue you with another manner of eſtimation in the World, then that which you would ever be able to obtain for your ſelves, by theſe other humane diligences, and deviſes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Of the third degree of Humility.</head>
               <p>THe third degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> is when a man poſſeſſing great vertues, and gifts of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170072:92"/>God, and being in great honor, and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, grows not as all proud thereby, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes any thing to himſelf, but refers, and aſcribes it all to the true fountain thereof, which is God, from whom every good and perfect gift proceeds. This third degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bonaventure</hi>) belongs to high, and perfect men: and by how much higher they are, ſo much the more low do they humble themſelves. That a man who is imperfect, and faulty, ſhould know, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem himſelf for ſuch, is no great matter. It is commendable, and good, but it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing, any more then it is, for the ſon of a Plough man, not to deſire to be held for the Kings ſon; or a poor man for poor, or a ſick man for ſick, and that others may hold them for ſuch as they know themſelves to be: but that a rich man ſhould account himſelf poor, and the great man make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf little, and ſo conform himſelf to mean perſons, this indeed deſerves to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrange. He ſaith, that it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, that a man who is imperfect and faulty, ſhould hold himſelf for imperfect, and faulty: nay rather it were to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, if being as he is, he ſhould hold himſelf to be perfect, and good: for it is as if being full of leaprouſie, he ſhould take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be found. But that he who is mightily advanced in vertue and poſſeſſes many gifts of God, and is really very great in his divine
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170072:93"/>preſence, ſhould yet hold himſelf for little, this indeed is great Humility, and worth the wondring at. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith. A great and rare vertue it is, that a man ſhould do great things, and yet not hold himſelf for great; that others ſhould evidently ſee his ſanctity, and yet that it ſhould lye bid from him; that he ſhould be admirable in the eyes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and contemptible in his own. I eſteem this more, (ſiath he) then all the other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which he can have.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Humility</hi> was found after a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner, in the moſt <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> who knowing that ſhe was choſen for the Mother of God, did acknowledg her ſelf, with moſt profound <hi>humility,</hi> to be his ſervant, and ſlave. Behold the handmaid of the Lord, (ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>) God having choſen her to ſo great an honour, and for ſo high a dignity, as to be his Mother, ſhe cals her ſelf his ſlave; and being celebrated by the mouth of <hi>Saint Elizabeth,</hi> for bleſſed amongſt all Women ſhe aſcribed not to her ſelf any glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for all theſe greatneſſes which were in her: but ſhe gave them all back again to God, exalting, and admiring him for them, and her ſelf remaining the while, moſt unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, &amp; intire in her own moſt profound Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſaid: <hi>My ſoul doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour: for he hath regarded the lowlines of his Handmaid.</hi> This is the very Humility of Heaven, the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170072:93"/>ſaints poſſeſſe this humilitie. And this (ſaith St: <hi>Gregory</hi>) is that which St: <hi>John</hi> ſaw, in the Apocalipſe, of thoſe four and twenty Elders, who being proſtrate before the throne of God, adored him, taking the Crovvns off from their heads, and caſting them down at the foot of the throne. And the Saint ſaith, that the caſting off their crowns, at the foot of the throne of God, ſignifies the not atributing their victories to themſelves, but the aſcribing all to God, who gave them ſtrength, and power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. It is reaſon, O Lord, that we give the honour and glory of all to thee, and that we take off the crowns from our heads, and that we caſt them at thy feet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe al is thine, and by thy wil it is made: and if we have any thing good, it is becauſe thou wouldſt have it ſo. This is then the 3d: degree of Humilitie, when a man aſcribes not theſe gifts, and graces to himſelf, which he hath received of God: but to aſcribe them, and refer them al to him as to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and giver of all good gifts.</p>
               <p>But ſom man may ſay, if Humility con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, we al are humble; for who is there who knows not, that al good coms to us from God, and that of our ſelves we have nothing but miſery, and ſin. Who is he that wil not ſay, if God ſhould take his hand off from me, I were the moſt miſerable man of the whole world. On our part we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170072:94"/>but deſtruction and ſin ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea.</hi> Al the favour, and al the good coms to us from the liberality of God, and this is Catholick doctrine: and ſo it may ſeem that we al have this Humility; for we al beleeve this truth, whereof the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is ful. The Apoſtle St: <hi>James,</hi> in his Canonical Epiſtle, ſaith, <hi>Al good and perfect gifts, com to us from above, from the Father of lights.</hi> And the Apoſtle St: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that we cannot work, nor ſpeak, nor deſire, nor think, nor begin, nor finiſh any thing, which may ſerve for our ſalvation, without God, from whom al our ſufficiency proceeds. And by what more clear compariſon could it be given us to underſtand al this, than by that which Chriſt our Lord himſelf declares? Wil you ſee, ſaith he, the little, or indeed the nothing which you can do without me, the vine branch cannot give fruit of it ſelf, unleſs it be united to the vine; ſo no man can perform any good work of himſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be united with me. <hi>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit:</hi> for <hi>without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Joh. 15.5. What is more fruitful than the branch, united to the vine? and what more unprofitable, and uſeleſs, than the branch parted from the vine? For what is it good? God interrogates the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel: What O Son of man ſhal be done with the branch of vine?</hi> It is not tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170072:94"/>which is fit for any Carpenters work nor yet for any ſtake, or pin wher upon any thing may be hanged againſt a wal. The branch ſevered from the vine, is fit for nothing, but the fire. Now juſt ſo, are we, if we be nor united to the true vine, which is Chriſt our Lord. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered, and men gather them, and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned.</hi> Joh: 15.6. We are good for nothing but the fire: and if we be any thing, it is by the grace of God, as St: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am.</hi> 1 Cor: 15.10. It ſeems we are al fully ſatisfied with the truth of this: That al the good we have is of God, and that we are to aſcribe no good to our ſelves, but al to God, to whom the honor and glory of al, is due. It ſeems, I ſay, that this is not very difficult, to ſuch as beleeve in Chriſt; and therefore that it ſhould not be ſet down, for the laſt, and moſt perfect degree of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> ſince it is ſo clearly a point of Faith.</p>
               <p>It ſeems ſo indeed, at the firſt ſight, if we look ſuperficially upon it; but indeed it is not eaſie, but very hard. <hi>Caſſian</hi> ſaith, that to ſuch as are but beginners, it ſeems to be but an eaſie thing, to attribute nothing to a mans ſelf, and not to reſt or rely upon his own induſtry, and diligence, but to refer and aſcribe al to God; but indeed it is very hard. For ſince we alſo contribute ſomwhat on
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170072:95"/>our part, towards good works, as St: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, becauſe we alſo work and concur joyntly with God, we grow tacitly, and even as it were without finding it, to confide in our ſelves; and a ſecret preſumption and pride ſteals upon us, which makes us think, that this or that was done by our diligence and care; and ſo by degrees, we grow vain, and look big, and aſcribe the works which we do to our ſelves: as if we had performed them by our own ſtrength; and as if they had been wholly ours. This is not ſo eaſie a buſineſs as we conceive. And it may ſuffice for us, that the ſaints ſet this down, for the moſt perfect degree of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and they ſay this is the <hi>Humilitie</hi> of the great ones; that we may ſo underſtand, that there is more difficulty, and perfection therein, than one would think. For a man to receive great gifts of God, and to do great things, and to give God al the glory of al as he ought; without attributing any thing to himſelf, and not to take any vain contentment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is a point of great perfection. To be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored and praiſed for a ſaint, and that no part of ſuch honor, and eſtimation ſhould ſtick at al to the heart, any more than if he had done nothing, is a very hard thing, and there are few who attain to it, and there is need of much virtue for the performance thereof.</p>
               <p>St: <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that to converſe in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170072:95"/>the midſt of honor, &amp; not to be at al toucht thereby, is like converſing much with beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful women, and yet never to look upon them with unchaſt eyes. It is a difficult, and a dangerous thing, and a man had need of much vertue therein: For a man to climbe ſo high, and not to be giddy, he had need be Maſter of a good head; All men have not a head, wherewith to walk on high: The Angels of Heaven, <hi>Luifer,</hi> and his Conſorts had it not; and ſo they grew giddy, and proud, and fell down into the bottomleſs pit of Hell. For this they ſay was the ſin of Angels, that when God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ſo beautifull, and had inriched them with ſo many, both naturall, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall gifts, they remained not in God, nor gave him the glory of all, but would needs ſubſiſt in themſelves; and yet not as conceiving, that of themſelves they had theſe things (for they knew well, that they all came from God, and that they depended upon him, ſince they knew they were his creatures) but, as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith, They grew proud in their beauty, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified themſelves in thoſe gifts, which they had received of God, and took delight in them, as if they had poſſeſſed them of themſelves, and did not aſcribe, or refer them all to God, giving him the honour and glory thereof: but they grew proud, and they exalted and contented themſelves
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170072:96"/>vainly in themſelves: So that, although with their underſtanding, they knew that the glory thereof was due to God, yet they robbed him of it, and took it to themſelves, with their will. By this time you ſee, that this degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> is not ſo eaſie, as it ſeemed, ſince the Angels found it ſo hard, that they fell from that height wherein God had placed them, becauſe they knew not how to conſerve themſelves therein. And now if the Angels had not heads wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to walk ſo high, but that they grew giddy, and fell down, much more reaſon have we to fear, leſt we may fail, when we are raiſed and exalted, becauſe we men are ſo miſerable creatures, that as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>We vaniſh even like ſmoak:</hi> As ſmoak, the higher it goes, the more it ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and diſſolves it ſelf: So man, who is ſo miſerable and ſo proud, the more he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and raiſed up to high eſtate, the more idle and intoxicated he grows.</p>
               <p>O how aptly, and how wel did Chriſt our Lord admoniſh us of this. The holy Goſpel relates, that having ſent his ſeventy two Diſciples to preach, they returned to him full of joy, and being, as it were proud of their miſſion, they ſaid thus to him, <hi>Lord we have done wonderfull things, yea, and the very Devils themſelves have obeyed us in thy Name.</hi> But the Saviour of the World an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them thus with great ſeverity, <hi>Luk.</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:170072:96"/>10.18. <hi>I beheld Satan as Lightning fall from Heaven.</hi> Take heed of vain contentment in your ſelves; know that <hi>Lucifer</hi> fell down from Heaven, becauſe in that high ſtate wherein he was created he was vainly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vvith himſelf, and vvith thoſe gifts and graces vvhich he had received, and did not aſcribe all to the honour and glory of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as he ought, but vvould needs take it to himſelf. Take heed the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen not to you; grovv not vain by reaſon of the great and vvonderfull things vvhich you do in my Name, and take no vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in them. And novv theſe vvords may alſo ſuit vvith us. Take heed you vvax not proud, in that great things are done by you, for the good of others, and many ſouls are gained by you means. Take heed you have no contentment in the applauſe and opinion of men, and in the much account they make of you. Be ſure you take nothing to your ſelves, and ſuffer not the love of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſtimation, to ſtick at all to your hearts, for this is that which caſt <hi>Lucifer</hi> down to hell, and that which of an Angel, made him a Devil. You may ſee (ſaith Sr. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) how deteſtable a thing <hi>Pride</hi> is, ſince it makes Angels Devils; and on the other ſide, how excellent a thing <hi>Humility</hi> is, ſince it makes men become like Angels.</p>

               <p>WE have not yet ſufficiently declared wherein the third degree of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> conſiſts; and therefore it will be fit to go on, that ſo we may the better put it in practice, this being the thing at which we aime. The Saints affirm, That this third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Humility</hi> conſiſts in knowing how to diſtin guiſh between the gold of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and benefits which comes to us from God, and the droſſe or miſery wherewith we abound in our ſelves, and then to give every one his due: to God, that which is his, and to our ſelves that which is ours; and that this be done by execution, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, wherein the life of this whole buſines conſiſts: So that <hi>Humility</hi> doth not conſiſt in knowing ſpeculatively, that of our ſelvs, we are good for nothing, and can effect nothing, and that all good things come to us from God, and that it is he who works the willing, the beginning, and the ending in us, through his free and gracious will, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares; for onely to know this ſpeculatively is a very eaſie thing, and all true Chriſtians know and beleeve it; but
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170072:97"/>to know and exerciſe it, in the way of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and to be ſo grounded and ſetled in it as if we ſaw it with our eyes, and touch't, and took it into our hands; this (as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith) is a moſt particular grace and high favour of Almighty God: to prove this, he brings that paſſage of Saint <hi>Paul, We have not received the ſpirit of this World, but the Spirit of God,</hi> to the end that we may know and feel the gifts which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his hand. For a man to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and even feel the graces which he hath received from God, ſo purely, as to eſteem them as meerly anothers, and to have been imparted, and to be enjoyed by the meer liberality and mercy of Almighty God, is a moſt particular favour and gift of his: And the wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, That this is ſupream Wiſdom, To underſtand and know practically, that to be continent, is not a thing which we are able to compaſſe by our own ſtrength; and that no induſtry or indeavour of our own, is able to obtain it; but that it is the gift of God, and that we muſt have it from his hand, is a point of ſu. pream wiſdom: So that in this which S <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, is a particular grace, and gift of God, and vvhich <hi>Solomon</hi> cals ſupream Wiſdom, conſiſts this third degree of <hi>Humility.</hi> What have vve, which we have not received; it was none of ours, for of our ſelves we have no good thing; and if we have received it,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170072:98"/>and that if it were anothers, and none of ours, Why do we glory, as if we had not received it, and as if it were properly our own.</p>
               <p>This was the <hi>humility</hi> of the Saints, who with being enriched by the gifts, and graces of Almighty God, and with his having raiſed them up to the very top of perfection, and thereby to honour and eſtimation, even in this world, have notwithſtanding held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for vile and baſe in their own eyes, and their ſouls remained ſo deeply fixed in the knowledg of their own meanes, and miſery, as if they had poſſeſſed no ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at all. There ſtuck not the leaſt vanity to their hearts, nor any ayre at al of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and eſtimation, which the world gave them; for they knew well, how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between their own, and that of others, and ſo they lookt upon all thoſe gifts, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, honour, and eſtimation, as things extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal to themſelves, and received from the hand of God; and to him they aſcribed, and gave all the glory, and praiſe thereof, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves remaining ſtill intire in the knowledg of their own unworthines, conſidering that of themſelves, they could neither have, nor do any good thing. And from thence it alſo came, that though the whole World exalted them, they would never yet exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor eſteem themelves one jot the more for that, nor did any little breach
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170072:98"/>thereof ſtick to their hearts. But it ſeemed to them that theſe praiſes were not uttered, as concerning them, but ſome other, to whom they belonged; namely God, in whom and in whoſe glory they placed all their contentment, and joy. And thus it is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much reaſon, that this is the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of great and perfect men. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it already preſuppoſes great vertue, and great gifts of God, which only makes one great in his ſight, and ſecondly, becauſe in it ſelf, for a man to be truly great in the ſight of God, and very eminent in vertue, and perfection, and for that reaſon to be highly valued, and eſteemed, both before God and man, and yet in the mdiſt of al this, to hold himſelf for little and baſe in his own eyes, is a great and admirable perfection. And this is that which Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> and Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> do ſo much wonder at in the Apoſtles, and others, who with being ſo great Saints, and ſo richly full of graces from God, and his Majeſty working ſuch wonders and miracles by their means, ſo far as even to raiſe the dead to life, and being ſo highly eſteemed for theſe things, by the whole world, they yet nevertheleſs remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſixed in their unworthines and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as if they had had nothing in them, and as if it had been ſome other, and not they who wrought thoſe great things and as if all that honour, and eſtimation, and praiſe, were
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170072:99"/>belonging to others, and as if they had been imparted to others, and not to them. Saint <hi>Bearnard</hi> ſaith, it is not much that a man in poverty and baſeneſs, ſhould be content to humble himſelf, for that which indeed he is, helps him to know, and diſeſteem himſelf, but that a man ſhould be generally honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and eſteemed for an admirable man, and for a Saint, and yet remain ſo well grounded in the truth of his own baſeneſs, and of his nothing, as if no part of thoſe other things, were in him; this indeed is a rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertue, and a point of moſt high perfection. In ſuch men ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> doth the light ſhine before men, according to the Commandement of our Lord, not for the glorifying of themſelves, but of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is in Heaven. Theſe are thoſe true imitators of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel, who publiſh not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe are thoſe good and faithfull ſervants who ſeek no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their own, nor aſcribe any thing to themſelves, but all and that moſt faithfully to God, to whom they give the glory of all. And ſo ſhall they be ſure to hear from the mouth of our Lord, thoſe words of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: <hi>Rejoyce thou, O good and faithfull ſervant, for becauſe thou haſt been faithfull in little, I will appoint, and place thee over much.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> The foreſaid truth is more declared.</head>
               <p>VVE have ſaid that the third degree of Humility, is when a man having great vertues, and gifts of God, and withall being in great honour and eſtimation with the World, grows not proud thereof; but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and aſcribes all to the fountain thereof, which is God, giving him the glory of all, himelf remaining the while, in his own un worthines, and baſeneſs, as if he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor had nothing. But now we ſay not, for all this, that we do not alſo work, or that we have not a part in thoſe good works which we do, for this were a great ignorance and errour.</p>
               <p>Nay rather, this is that very thing, which makes this degree of Humility ſo very hard to be obtained: for on the one ſide, we are to uſe all our diligences, and to imploy all the means we can to obtain vertue, and to reſiſt temptations, and to procure that all things may ſucceed well, as if theſe things alone were able to effect it; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, when all this is done, we are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt our elves as much, and we hold our ſelves for as unprofitable, as if God had done nothing at all, and we muſt place our whole confidence in God, as the holy oſpel teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170072:100"/>
                  <hi>When you have done all thoſe things which are commanded you,</hi> (he ſpeaks not of ſome, but of all) <hi>ſay that you are unprofitable ſervants;</hi> and to ſay this right, you will have need of ſome vertue, and not a little. <hi>Caſſianus</hi> ſaith, That he who comes to know well that he is an unprofitable ſervant, and that all his own endeavours and diligences, are not able to obtain any one good things, but that all is to flow from the gracious gifts of Almighty god, this man will not grow proud when he prevails in any thing, which he obtained not by his own labour, but by the grace and goodnes of God. Which is alſo the ſame that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. <hi>What haſt thou, which thou haſt not received.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> brings a very good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, to declare this truth and ſaith: That without the grace of God, we are no more but meerly a body without a ſoul. So that as a body which is dead, cannot move, or ſtir it ſelf, ſo we, without the grace of God, cannot perform the works of life, or value in the ſight of God. So that as that body were a mad kind of thing, which ſhould aſſume the acts of living, and moving to it ſelf, and not aſcribe it to the ſoul which dwels in it, and gives it life; ſo were that ſoul to be ſtark blind, which doth attribute the good works which it doth, to it ſelf, and not to God, who infuſed into it the ſpirit of life, which is his grace; to the end that ſo he might be able
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170072:100"/>to perform them. And in another place he ſaith, that as our corporal eyes, though they be never ſo ſharp ſighted, yet if they be not aſſiſted by the light of the Sun, can diſcern nothing; ſo a man, how much ſoever he may be juſtified, cannot ſo much as continue to live well, if he be not enabled by the light of Gods grace. <hi>If our Lord keep not the City</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David, in vain doth he watch who keeps it.</hi> O ſaith the Saint, that men would at length know themſelves, and now at length, underſtand themſelves as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that they have nothing in themſelves, whereof to glory, but only in Almighty God. O that God would ſend us ſome beam of light from heaven, whereby we might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and underſtand our own darknes: and that there is no good, nor being, nor ſtrength in any thing which ever was created, but only ſo far forth, as our Lord hath been graciouſly pleaſed to give it, and is ſtill plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to continue it. Now in this doth the third degree of <hi>humility</hi> conſiſt, ſaving that no poor words of ours can arrive to expreſs the profunditie, and great perfection which is therein, notwithſtanding all that which we can ſay, ſometimes after one manner and ſometimes after another: and not only is the practiſe hereof hard, but even the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo.</p>
               <p>This is that annihilation of a mans ſelf, which is ſo often repeated, and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170072:101"/>by the maſters of ſpiritual life. this is that holding, and coufeſſing a mans ſelf for unworthy, and unprofitable to all purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Which is ſet down, for the moſt perfect degree of Humility. This is that diſtruſt of a mans ſelf, and that being ſtill depending upon God, which is ſo recommended to us in holy Scripture. This is that holding himſelf in no account at all, whereof we are ever talking, and hearing; but O that we might find it once for all in our very hearts. That we might underſtand, and feel in very truth, and practically, as a man who ſees things with his eyes, and touches, and feels them with his hands, that, for as much as is on our part we neither have any thing but miſery, nor can do any thing but commit ſin, and that all the good which we effect, or work, we neither exerciſe it, nor have it of our ſelves, but only of God; and that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glory of all is his.</p>
               <p>And if with having ſaid all this, you yet underſtand not fully the perfection of this degree of <hi>humility,</hi> do not wonder at it; for this is a very high peece of Divinity; and therfore it is not ſtrange, though it be not ſo eaſily underſtood. A certain Doctor ſaith very well, that it happens in all arts, and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that every body arrives to know ſuch things as are common and plain, but as for ſuch others as are curious, and choice, they are not to be reached by every hand, but by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170072:101"/>ſuch only as are eminent in that ſcience, or art. And juſt ſo it is in our caſe; for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and uſuall things belonging to any vertue, are underſtood by al the World; but ſuch as are extraordinary, and choice, and nice, and high, can only be comprehended by ſuch as are eminent, and fully poſſeſſed of that vertue. And this is that which <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius Juſtitinianus</hi> ſaith, namely; That no man knows well what <hi>humility</hi> is, but he vvho hath received the gift of being humble from God. And from hence it alſo grows, that in regard the Saints were indued vvith ſuch a moſt profound Humility, that they thought, and ſaid ſuch things of themſelves that we who fall ſo far ſhort of them, cannot underſtand exactly what they ſay: but their ſpeeches ſeem exaggerations, as namely that they were the greateſt ſinners of the whole world, and the like, where of I will ſpeak ere long. But if we cannot ſay or think ſuch things as they, no nor even underſtand them, it is becauſe we have not arrived to ſo great <hi>Humility,</hi> as theirs was, and ſo we underſtand not the curious, and ſubtill parts of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Procure you to be humble, and to grow up in this ſcience, and to profit therein more and more, and then you vvill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand hovv ſuch things as thoſe, may be ſaid vvith truth.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP: XXIX.</hi> The third degree of Humility is further declared, and how it grows from thence, that the true humble man eſteems himſelf to be the leaſt, and worſt of all.</head>
               <p>TO the end that vve may yet better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtand this third degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> and may ground our ſelves vvell therein; it vvill be neceſſary for us to go back, and take up the matter neerer the fountain. And as according to vvhat vve ſaid before, all our natural being, and all the naturall operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vvhich vve have, vve have from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we were nothing, and then we had no power either to move our ſelves, or to ſee, or hear, or taſt, or underſtand, or will but God who gave us our natural being, gave us theſe faculties, and powers, and we muſt aſcribe our being, as alſo theſe namral operations to him; ſo in the ſelf ſame manner, and with much greater reaſon muſt we ſay; in the caſe of a ſupernatural being, and of the works of grace, and that ſo much more, as theſe are greater, and more excellent than thoſe. We have not our ſupernaturall being of our ſelves, but of God. In ſine it is a being
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170072:102"/>of ſavour and grace, and therefore it is ſo called, becauſe out of his meer goodnes, he added that, to our natural being. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2, 3. We were born in ſin, we were the children of wrath, and the enemies of God, who drew us out of that darknes, into his admirable light, as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith: 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2.9. Of enemies, God made us friends, of ſlaves, Sons, from being nothing worth, he brought us to be acceptable in his own eies. And the cauſe why God did all this, was not for any reſpect either of our merits paſt, or ſervices to come; but only for his own bounty, and mercy, and through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, our only Lord and Saviour, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now then, as we were not able to get out of that nothing, wherein we were, into the natural being which now we have, nor were able to perform the acts of life, nor ſee, nor hear, nor feel, but all this was the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gift of God, and to him we muſt aſcribe it all, without taking the glory of it to our ſelves, ſo could we never have gone out of that darknes of ſin, wherein we were, and in which we were conceived and born, if God of his infinite goodnes and mercy, had not drawn us out from thence, nor could we now perform the works of ſpiritual life, if he gave us not his grace to that end. For the vertue and worth of good works, grows
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170072:103"/>not from that part thereof, which they have from us, but from vvhat they have from the grace of our <hi>Lord,</hi> juſt ſo as the legal value which curtant money hath, it hath not from it ſelf, but from the ſtamp or coyn. And therefore we muſt not aſcribe any glory at all to our ſelves, but all to God, from whom both our natural, and ſupernatural being is derived; carrying ever that of St: <hi>Paul</hi> both in our mouths, and in our hearts. <hi>I am whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am, by the meer grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, as according to what we ſaid God, not only drew us out of our nothing, and gave us that being which now we have, but after we are created, and have received, our being, we do not ſubſiſt in our ſelves, but God is ever ſuſtaining, upholding, and conſerving us, with his hand of power, that ſo we may nor fal into that former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Abiſſe of nothing, from whence he took us before; in the ſame manner is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in the caſe of our ſupernatural being; for not only did God ſhew us the favour to bring us out of the darknes of ſin, wherein we were, into the admirable light of his grace; but he is ever conſerving, and holding us up with his hand, that ſo we may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to fall. And this, to ſuch a proportion, as that if God ſhould take off his hand of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody from us, but for one inſtant, &amp; ſhould give the Devil leave to tempt us at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; we ſhould return both to our former,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170072:103"/>and to greater ſins: ſaid the Prophet <hi>David. Thou O Lord, art ever at my ſide holding me up, that I may not be pluckt down; it is thy work O Lord, to have raiſed me up from ſin; thine to have kept me from returning to ſin again. If I roſe up, it was becauſe thou gaveſt me thy hand; and if now I be on foot, it is becauſe thou holdeſt me from dropping down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since therefore, as we ſhewed it before to be ſufficient to make us hold our ſelves for nothing, becauſe on our part, we are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, we were nothing, and we ſhould be nothing, if God were not ever conſerving us: ſo this is alſo ſufficient to make us ever keep our ſelves in the account of being wicked ſinners, becauſe, for as much as is on our part, we are ſinners, we were ſinners, and we would be ſinners, if God were not ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding us, with his holy hand. <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> ſaith, that whoſoever would obtain <hi>Humility,</hi> muſt plant the root thereof in his heart, which conſiſts in that he know his own weaknes, and miſery, and underſtand, and weigh not only how vile and wretched he is now, but how vile and wretched he may be, yea, and would be even very now, if God with his powerful hand, did not keep him, and ſin aſunder: and did not remove the occaſions, and aſſiſt, and ſtrengthen him in temptations. Into how many ſins had I fallen, if thou O Lord through thy infinite mercy, hadſt not kept me up? how many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170072:104"/>of my ſinning haſt thou prevented, which were ſufficient to have pulled me down, as they pulled down the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi> if thou, knowing my weaknes, if thou I ſay hadſt not hindred them? How many timeshaſt thou tyed the devils hands, to the end that he might not rempt me at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and if he would tempt me, that yet he ſhould not be able to overcome me? How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten might I have ſaid thoſe words of the Prophet, with much truth. <hi>If thou O Lord hadſt not holpen me, this ſoul of mine had already been little leſſe, then in the very bottom of Hell.</hi> Hovv often have I been aſſaulted, and even almoſt tripped up, tovvards falling: and thou O Lord didſt hold me, and didſt apply thy ſweet and ſtrong hand, that I might take no hurt. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 94.18. If I ſaid that my foot ſlipt thy mercy O Lord came to help me. O how often ſhould we have been loſt, if God, through his infinite mercy, and goodnes, had not preſerved us? This is then the account wherein we are to hold our ſelves: becauſe this we are, and this we poſſeſſe on our parts, and this we were, and this we ſhould alſo be again, if God took off his hand, and cuſtody from us.</p>
               <p>From hence it came, that the Saints deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, humbled, and confounded themſelves ſo far, that they were not content to eſteem little of themſelves, and to hold that they were vvicked, and ſinful men; but they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170072:104"/>thought themſelves the meaneſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yea and the moſt unvvorthy, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men in the World. The ſame did the holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirm, touching himſelf: <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt came into this World to ſave ſinners, of whom I am the firſt, or chief.</hi> And ſo he adviſes us to procure. to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this <hi>Humility,</hi> that vve hold our ſelves for inferior, and leſſe then all others, and that we acknowledg them all for our ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, and betters. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, The Apoſtle deceives us not, when he ſaith, That we muſt hold our ſelves for the leaſt of all, and that we muſt eſteem all others to be our ſuperiors, and betters: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2 3. <hi>Rom:</hi> 12.10. &amp; he commands not hereby, that we ſhould uſe any words of flattery, or courtſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. The Saints did not ſay with counterfeit <hi>humility,</hi> and telling a lye, that they were the greateſt ſinners in the world: but meerly according to truth, becauſe they thought ſo in their very hearts, and ſo they alſo give us in charge, that we think, and ſay the ſame, and this not by complement, or with fiction.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ponders very well to this purpoſe, that ſaying of our bleſſed Saviour. <hi>Luk:</hi> 14.10. When you ſhall be invited, ſit you down in thelaſt, and loweſt place. He ſaid not, that you ſhould chooſe a middle place, or that you ſhould ſit amongſt the loweſt; or in the laſt place but one: but
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170072:105"/>he will only have you ſit in the very loweſt place of all. Not only are you not, to prefer your ſelves before any, but not ſo much as to preſume to compare, or equal your ſelves with any other: but you are only to remain in the laſt place, without any equal in your baſenes, eſteeming your ſelves to be the moſt miſerable ſinners of the whole World. It puts you, ſaith he, to no danger, if perhaps you ſhould humble your ſelves too much, and put your ſelves under the feet of all; but the preferring your ſelves before any one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, may put you to a great deal of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. And he brings this ordinary compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. As when you paſſe by a low gate, the ſtooping too much with your head, can do you no hurt, but if you ſtoop never ſo little leſſe then the gate requires, you may do your ſelves ſo much hurt, as to break your head; ſo it is alſo in the foul. For to abaſe and humble your ſelves too much, cannot be hurtful, but to forbear to humble yourſelves though it be but a little to prefer, or even equal your ſelves to any one, it is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing. What knoweſt thou (O man) whether that one whom thou takeſt, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be worſe than thou (for perhaps it ſeems to thee now, that thou art grown to live well) but that he is a wicked man, and the greateſt ſinner in the whole World may not prove perhaps a better man, than either they or thou, yea and that he is ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170072:105"/>in the ſight of God. Who knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will nor change hands, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and that the lots will be alſo changed; and that thou wilt come to be the forſaken, and the other choſen? How do you know what God hath wrought in that heart ſince yeſterday, yea and in this laſt minute. In one inſtant, is God able to make Apoſtles of a Publican, and a Perſecutor, as he did of Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Of ſinners more ſtony and hard than a Diamond, can God make ſons for himſelf. How mightily did that Phariſe find himſelf deceived, when he judged Saint <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> for wicked, and when Chriſt our Lord reproved him, and gave him to underſtand that ſhe whom he held for a publique ſinner, was better than he. And ſo <hi>Aquinus</hi> ſets this down for one of the twelve degrees of <hi>Humility.</hi> To ſay and think of himſelf, that he is the worſt man of the whole World. It is not enough to ſay ſo with the tongue, but it muſt be felt with the very heart. Think not that thou haſt profited at all, if thou hold not thy ſel for the vvorſt of men.</p>

               <p>IT will not be matter of curioſity, but of much profit, to declare how good, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, may with truth eſteem themſelves eſſe then all; and alſo affirm that they are the greateſt ſinners of the whole world; For we have ſaid that we muſt procure to arrive thus far Some of the Saints refuſe to anſwer the queſtion, how this may be; and content themſelves with beleeving of themſelves, that they are ſo in their hearts Saint <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> relates, that the holy <hi>Hoſimus</hi> being one day ſpeaking of <hi>Humility,</hi> &amp; ſaying ſo of himſelf; a certain Philoſopher was there, who asked him how he could hold himſelf to be ſo great a ſinner, ſince he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to live ſo uprightly, and holily. To which the holy man made this anſwer, I ſay that this which I have ſaid is true, and that I ſpeak as I think; and therefore ask me no more queſtions. But Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> and other Saints give an anſwer to this queſtion, and they do it divers wayes. That
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170072:106"/>of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> is, that a man placing his eyes upon his own defects, and conſidering in his Neighbours the ſecret gifts which he hath, or at leaſt may have of God; every one may with truth affirm of himſelf, that he is the vileſt, and greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the whole World; for he knows his own defects, and know not another mans graces or gifts. Obut ſay you, I ſee that he commits many ſins, which I commit not. But yet how do you know, what God hath wrought in his heart, ſince that time. In a moment, may God have ſecretly imparted ſome giſt and favour to that man, which may have made him excell you, as it hapned to that Phariſe, and that Publican of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who went into the Temple to pray. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay to you, (ſaid Chriſt our Lord) that the Publican who was held for ſo wicked, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned juſtified out of the Temple, and the Phariſe who was held for good, went out condemned. This alone might ſerve to fright us, and to make us not preſume, I ſay not, to prefer our ſelves before, but even not to compare our ſelves with any, and to make us keep our ſelves in the loweſt place of all: which certainly is moſt ſecure. And for him who is truly humble, and from the heart, it is a moſt eaſie thing to hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the loweſt, and leaſt account of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For the truly humble man conſiders in other men the goodnes and vertue which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170072:107"/>they have, and in himſelf he obſerves but his own defects; and he is ſo buſie, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt about the knowledg and redreſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that he hath no leiſure to lift up his eyes towards the faults of others, as conceiving himſelf to have enough of his own to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and ſo he holds all other men for good, and himſelf for wicked. And by how much the more holy any man is, ſo much the more eaſie is this to him; for after the rate, or the increaſe of his other vertues, the knowing, deſpiſing, and humbling himſelf, doth alſo encreaſe, for all theſe things go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And ſtill the more light he hath from Heaven, and the more knovvledg of the goodneſs, and Majeſty of Almighty God, the more profound underſtanding vvill he come to have of his ovvn miſery, and of his nothing, becauſe, <hi>Abyſſus abyſſum invocat: Pſal:</hi> 42.9. That depth of the knovvledg of the goodneſs, and greatnes of God, cals up, and diſcovers that other profound depth of our miſery, and makes us able to diſcern the infinite little moats, and grains of duſt of our imperfections. And if we hold our ſelves in any account, it is certainly, becauſe we have ſmal knowledg of God, and little light from Heaven. The beams of the ſun of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, have not yet entred in by our win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſo vve do not onely not ſee the moats which are our leſſe defects, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, but we are ſo ſhort ſighted, or
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170072:107"/>rather indeed ſo very blind, that vve ſcarce diſcern our greater ſins.</p>
               <p>To this it may be added, that <hi>God</hi> loves <hi>humility</hi> in us ſo much, and it is ſo very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him, that vve ſhould hold our ſelves in no account, and conſerve our ſelves ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; that, in order to this end, he is wont ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in the caſe of his great ſervants, to vvhom he imparts many high benefits, and ſavours, to diſguiſe his gifts, and to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them in ſuch a ſecret, and ſtrange manner, that even the man himſelf who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them, doth not throughly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, and thinks they are nothing. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith: All that beakty of the Tabernacle vvas covered vvith the skins of Beaſts. And ſo uſeth <hi>God</hi> to conceal, and cover the beauty of mens vertues, and of his ovvn graees, and benefits; by permitting va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of temptations, yea and ſometimes of ſome errors and im perfections, that ſo they may be the more ſafely conſerved, as burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coals under aſhes might be.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>John Climacus</hi> ſaith, that as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil procures to lay our vertues, and good vvorks before our eys, that ſo vve may grovv proud becauſe he deſires our ruine, ſo on the contrary ſide, our <hi>Lord God,</hi> becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires our greater good, gives more particular light to his ſervants, that ſo they may ſee their ovvn faults, and imperfections, and he covers, and diſguiſes his giſts and graces to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170072:108"/>them, that even the man himſelf who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them, may not be able expreſly to underſtand them. And this is the common Doctrine of the Saints: Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, To conſerve <hi>Humility</hi> in the ſervants of God, his divine goodneſs diſpoſes things in ſuch fort, as that the more a man profits, the leſſe he conceives himſelf to profit: and when he is arrived to the higheſt degree of vertue, Almighty God permits him to be ſubject to ſome ſuch imperfection, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the firſt degree; to the end that he may conceive himſelf not to have fully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo much as that; and of the ſame doth Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeak in many places.</p>
               <p>For this, do ſome very well compare Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and ſay that it reſpects other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as the Sun doth other Stars; and that, for this reaſon, as when the Sun appears, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stars lye hidden, and are concealed; ſo when Humility is in the ſoul, other vertues are not ſeen, and the humble man conceives that he hath no ſolid vertue at all. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith. Their vertues being manifeſt to all men, only themſelves ſee them not. The holy Scripture recounts of Moſes. that when he came from ſpeaking with God, he carried a great brightnes in his face, which the children of Iſrael ſaw, but for his part, he ſaw it not. So the humble man, ſees no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in himſelf. all that which he ſees, ſeems faults, and imperfections to him yea and he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170072:108"/>further beleeves, that the leaſt part of his miſeries is that which he knows, and that he is ignoraht of the greater, and now in the midſt of this, it will be eafie for him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem himſelf below all, and for the greateſt ſinner of the whole World.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certain, (to the end that we may conceal nothing) that as there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeveral wayes, whereby God is wont to conduct his Elect, ſo he leads many by this way, whereof vve have ſpoken, namely, of concealing his gifts from them, ſo that them ſelves may not ſee them, nor conceive that they have them; but he manifeſts them to others, and makes them know them, to the end, that they may eſteem his ſervants, and be pleaſed in them. And ſo ſaith the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul: We have not received the ſpirit of this World, but the Spirit of God; that we may know the gifts and graces, which we receive from his hand.</hi> And the moſt <hi>holy</hi> Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did very well both knovv, and acknovvledg the great graces, and gifts, vvhich ſhe poſſeſſed, and had received from Almighty God: as ſhe faith in her Canticle. <hi>My ſouldoth magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and exalt our Lord, becauſe he who is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, hath wrought mighty things in me.</hi> And this is not only not contrary to <hi>humility,</hi> and perfection, but it is accompanied with an <hi>humility</hi> ſo very much elevated, and ſo high, that for this reaſon the Saints are wont to ſtile it, the humility of great, and perfect men.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:170072:109"/>
               <p>But yet here, there is a great error, and danges, whereof we are advertiſed by the Saints, and it is when ſome think of themſelves, that they have more graces of God, than indeed they have. In which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was that miſerable Creature, to whom God commanded this to be ſaid in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calipſe; <hi>Thou ſa iſt that thou art rich, and that thou haſt need of nothing, but thou doſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thine own caſe, for thou art miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> In the ſame er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, was that Phariſe who gtave God thanks, that he was not like others, beleeving of himſelf, that he had what indeed he had not: and that therefore he was better then other men: And ſometimes, this kind of pride ſteals in upon us, ſo ſecretly, and with ſuch diſguiſe, that almoſt before we know where we are, we grow very full of our ſelves, and of our own eſtimation. And for this, it is an excellent remedy, that we ever carry our eyes open, towards the vertues of others, and ſhut up towards our own, and ſo to live ever in a holy kind of fear, whereby we our ſelves will be more ſafe, and the gifts of God better kept.</p>
               <p>But yet in fine, foraſmuch as our Lord is not tyed to this, he conducts his ſervants by ſeveral wayes. Sometimes as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: he will do his ſervants the particular favour, of making them know the gifts which they have received from
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170072:109"/>his hand. And in this caſe, it ſeems that the thing in queſtion hath more difficulty, namely, how theſe Saints, and ſpiritual men, who know and ſee in themſelves, ſo great gifts which they have received from God, can with truth eſteem themſelves below all; and affirm of themſelves with all, that they are the greateſt ſinners of the whole World. When our Lord conducts a man by that other way of hiding his gifts, that ſo he ſees no vertue in himſelf, but all his faults and imperfections: the difficulty is not ſo great, but in theſe others, how can it be? Notwithſtanding all this, it may be very well. Be you humble like to that holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you ſhall know how. His compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion preſſing to underſtand, how he could think and ſay ſo of himſelf with truth; he made this anſwer. Really I underſtand it as I ſpeak it, and I beleeve, that if God had ſtewed thoſe mercies, and imparted thoſe graces to any murthering theef, or to the greateſt ſinner in the whole World which he hath vouchſafed to me, he would have been much better, and more grateful than I. And on the other ſide, I conceive, and beleeve, that if our Lord ſhould take off his hand from me, and not hold me faſt, I ſhould commit greater ſins, and ſhould prove the moſt wicked man in the whole World. And for this reaſon he ſaith, I am the greateſt ſinner and the moſt ungratef
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170072:110"/>of all men. And this is a very good anſwer, and a very profound <hi>humility,</hi> and it carried Doctrine in it, of admirable inſtruction. This knowledg and conſideration, is that which made the Saints dive down ſo low under the carth, and caſt themſelves at the feet of all men, and really eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the greateſt ſinners of the whole World, for they had that root of <hi>Humility</hi> vvhich is the knovvledg of their own miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and frailty, wel planted, and deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hearts: and they knevv very vvell hovv to penetrate and ponder both vvhat they vvere, and vvhat they had of themſelves; and this made it eaſie for them to beleeve, that if God ſhould not hold them faſt, but once take off his hand, from their heads, they would have proved the greateſt finners of the World; and ſo they held themſelves, for ſuch. And as for thoſe gifts and graces vvhich they had received from God, they beheld them not, as any thing of their ovvn, but as the goods of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and only lent to them. And not only did the having of all theſe gifts, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, or hinder them from remaining intire in their poorneſs, and baſeneſs, or from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming themſelves belovv all others, but it rather helpt them on tovvards that end, becauſe they thought they profited not thereby, as they ought to have done. So that vvhich vvay ſoever, vve turn our eyes,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170072:110"/>whether vve caſt them inward, upon what we have of our ſolves, or wherther we caſt of God; we ſhall find occaſion enough to be humbled; and to eſteem our ſelves below al.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> to this purpoſe, ponders thoſe words which <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> after he might have killed him in the Cave into which <hi>Saul</hi> had entred. And when <hi>David</hi> ſpared his life, and let him go, he yet went after him, ſaying. Whom doſt thou perſecute O King of Iſrael? thou perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt a dead dogg, and a ſingleflea, as I am; The Saint poinders it thus very well, <hi>David</hi> was already anointed for King, and had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood from the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him, that God would take the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from <hi>Saul;</hi> &amp; give it him, &amp; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the leſs; he humbles and leſſens himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, though he knew that God had preferred him, and that in the ſight of God, he was a better man than <hi>Saul.</hi> Whereby we may learn, to eſteem our ſelves leſs, than them, of whom we know not, in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or degree they ſtand, in the preſence of Almighty God.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP: XXXI.</hi> That this third degree of Humility is a good means to overcome all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to obtain the perfection of all the vertues.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>CAſſianus</hi> ſaith, that it was a tradition of thoſe antient Fathers, and as it were the firſt principle amongſt them, that a man could not obtain purity of heart, and the perfection of vertue, if firſt he did not conceive and know, that all his induſtry diligence, and labour, would not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for that purpoſe, without the eſpeciall favour and help of God, who is the prime Author, and giver of all good things. And he ſaith moreover, that this knowledg of his muſt not be only ſpeculative, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have heard it or read it, or becauſe it is a Doctrine of Faith; but we muſt know it practically, and by experience, and be ſo convinced, ſo reſolved, and ſetled in this truth, as if we ſaw it with our eyes, and touch't it with our hands: and this is litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the third degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> whereof now we treat. And of this kind of <hi>Humility</hi> it is, that the authorities of holy Scripture ſpeak, and which promiſe ſo great, and even innumerable bleſſings, to ſuch as are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And for this reaſon the Saints aſſign it
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170072:111"/>for the laſt, and moſt perfect degree of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſay, that it is the foundation of all vertue, and the preparation, or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for receiving all kind of graces, and gifts from God. And <hi>Caſſianus</hi> proſecuting this point more in particular, ſaith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chaſtity, that no endeavour of ours, will ſerve for the obtaining thereof, till we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly underſtand, that it is not to be had, but from the liberality and mercy of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. And Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> agrees ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well herewith. For the firſt and chief means, which he delivers for the acquiring and conſerving the gift of chaſtity, is <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> that ſo we may not think, that our own diligences will ſuffice for this: for if we rely and reſt upon them, we deſerve to looſe it. But we muſt know, that it is the gift of God, and that it muſt come to us from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and that we muſt place our whoſe confidence in him. And ſo one of thoſe old Fathers ſaid, that a man would be tempted with carnal thoughts, till he come to know very well, that chaſtity is the gift of our <hi>Lord:</hi> and no acquiſition of our own. <hi>Palladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> confirms this, by the example of <hi>Abbat Moyſes,</hi> who hauing been a man of a ſtrange corporal ſtrength, as alſo of a moſt vicious mind, was converted afterward to God, with his vvhole heart. At the firſt, he was grievouſly tempted, eſpecially concerning imputity; and by the advice of thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170072:112"/>he imployed his beſt means to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. He prayed ſo long, as that he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſix years in prayer, yea and ſpent the greateſt part of the whole nights in prayer, remaining ſtill upon his feet. He uſed much handy labour, he eat nothing but bread; and that in ſmall quantity: he went carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water to the old Monks in their Cels, and uſed many other greater wortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and auſterities. But yet, with all this, he came not to be free from his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but was even ſet on fire by them; and was ſometimes in danger to fall, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his purity. Being then in this trouble, the holy Abbat <hi>Iſidorus</hi> came to him: nd told him on the part of God, that for that time forward, his temptations ſhould ceaſe in the name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; and ſo they did, and never ſet upon him more. And the Saint, by way of declaring the cauſe, adds this; that till then, God had not given compleat Victory to Abbat <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> leſt he ſhould have grown vain and proud; as con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eiving that he had conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own ſtrength: and therefore that God had, till then, permitted it for his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good. <hi>Moſes</hi> had not yet obtained the gift of diſtruſting himſelf and now to the end that he might obtain it, and not grow proud by confiding in himſelf, God left him ſo long a time, and he obtained not by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo great endeavours, the compleat
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170072:112"/>victory over this paſſion, which others by diligence had obtained.</p>
               <p>The like did <hi>Palladius</hi> relate to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Abbat <hi>Pacon;</hi> for even whilſt he was ſeventy years old; he was very much moleſted by unclean temptations: and he ſaith, that the other affirmed it to him, with an Oath, that after he was fifty years old, the combat had been ſo uſual, and ſo very fierce, as that there had not paſſed either one day or night, in all that time, wherein he had not been tempted to that ſin. He did very extraordinary things to free himſelf from theſe temptations: but they did not ſerve the turn. And lamenting one day, and even half fearing, that our Lord had ſorſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him, he heard a voice which interiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid thus to him: know that the cauſe why <hi>God</hi> hath permitted this ſharp aſſault to be made againſt thee, hath been to the end, that thou mighteſt know thy own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and miſery, and the little or nothing which thou haſt of thy ſelf; and therefore ſee that thou humble thy ſelf hereafter, and confide not in thy ſelf at all; but in al things have recourſe for help to me. And he ſaith, that he was ſo comforted by this inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he never felt that temptation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. In fine, the Will of our Lord is, that we put all our confidence in him, and that we diſtruſt our ſelves with all our own dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and means.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:170072:113"/>
               <p>This is the Doctrine not only of Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Caſſian,</hi> and thoſe antient Fathers, but of the Author, and book of Wiſdom himſelf; and that in thoſe very terms, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have expreſſed it here. For the wiſe man, in the book of Wiſdom, ſets expreſly down, both the Theory, and the practiſe of this point in theſe words. <hi>When I knew</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I could not be continent, Wiſ.</hi> 8.21. (ſo the vulgar Latine readeth) but by the gift of God. Now continent is here the general word, which comprehends not only the containing, or reſtraining that paſſion which is againſt chaſtity, but all the other paſſions alſo, which rebel againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And that other place alſo of <hi>Eccleſ. No weight of Gold, is able to go in ballance with a continent ſoul. No pretious thing, is ſo much worth as the perſon, who is continent.</hi> He means that kind of man, who intirely contains all his affections, and appetites, that they may not paſſe beyond the bounds of reaſon And now, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> knowing that I could not contain theſe paſſions, and powers, both of my body and ſoul, within the moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vertue and truth, without the eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gift of God: but that ſometimes they would exceed (the knowledg whereof is a high point of Wiſdom) I had recourſe to our Lord, and begged this gift of him, with my whole heart: So that, in fine, this is the only means, whereby a man may become
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170072:113"/>continent: and may be able to continue continent, to reſtrain and govern our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bind over all temptations, and the perfection of all Vertues. And ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet underſtood it rightly, when he ſaid. <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, their labour is but loſt that build it. Except the Lord keepeth the City, the watchman waketh but in vain. Pſa.</hi> 127.1, 2. It is he who muſt give us all good things, and when he hath given them, muſt conſerve them to us; or els all our labour will be loſt.</p>

                  <hi>AQuinas</hi> treating of the vertue of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, makes this queſtion. On the one ſide the Saints ſay, yea and the holy Scripture alſo ſaith, that <hi>Humility</hi> is very neceſſary for us, and withall, that magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is alſo neceſſary; eſpecially ſo ſuch, as exerciſe high Miniſtries, and live in high place. Now theſe two vertues ſeem to be contrary in themſelves, becauſe magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a greatnes of mind to attempt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize great, and excellent things, which in themſelves may be worthy of honour, and both the one and the other ſeem to be
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170072:114"/>contrary to Humility. For as for the firſt, which is to enterpriſe great things, this ſeems not to ſure well, with this vertue, becauſe one of the degrees of <hi>Humility,</hi> which the Saints aſſign, is, To confeſſe, and hold himſelf unworthy, and unprofitable for all things; and now for a man to attempt that for vvhich he is not fit, ſeems to be preſumption, and pride. And as for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, vvhich is to enterpriſe things of honour, it ſeems alſo to be contrary, becauſe the true humble man, muſt be very farfrom deſiring honour and eſtimation. To this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> anſvvers very vvell and ſayes, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in appearance, and by the exteriour ſound of the Words, theſe tvvo vertues may ſeem to be contrary, betvveen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: yet in effect and truth, one vertue cannot be contrary to another; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he ſaith concerning theſe tvvo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Humility, and magnanimity, that if vve vvill attentively caſt our eyes upon the truth, and ſubſtance of the thing, vve ſhall not only find that they are not contrary, but that they are direct Siſters, and depend much upon one another. And this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares very vvell, becauſe as for the firſt, vvhich is to enterpriſe and attempt great things, vvhich is proper to the magnanimous perſons, it is not only not contrary to the humble man; but rather is very proper to him, and he vvho is the one, may very vvel
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170072:114"/>do the other. If confiding in our own dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and ſtrength, we ſhould undertake great things, it might be preſumption, and pride, becauſe we may not undertake things either great or ſmall, in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our own ſtrength, for as much as of our ſelves, we are not able to have one good thought, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. But the firm foundation of this vertue of magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, to attempt and enterpriſe great things is to be by diſtruſting our ſelves, and all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane endeavours, and to put our whole confidence in God; and this doth Humility alſo, and therefore do the Saints call it, the foundation of all the vertues, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe it opens the ſoyl, and ſounds deep into the very bottom, and takes out all the ſand and looſe ſtuffe, till at length it arrive to that living rock, which is Chriſt our Lord, that ſo we may build there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> upon that place of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. <hi>Who is this which riſes up from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, aboundning in delights, and leaning upon her beloved,</hi> goes declaring how all our vertue, our ſtrength, and all our good works, are to rely, and reſt upon our Beloved. And he brings for an example, that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace which was beſtowed upon me, was not in vain: but I labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more abundantly than they all.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170072:115"/>begins to recount his labours, and how much he had done in the preaching of the Goſpel, and the ſervice of the Church, till at length he came to ſay, that he had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more than the reſt of the Apoſtles. St <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith. Take heed what you ſay O holy Apoſtle. To the end that you may be able to ſay this, yea and to the end that you may not looſe it: rely upon your Beloved. Now he replyes upon his Beloved. <hi>Not I, but the grace of God in me: Phil.</hi> 4.13. And writing to the <hi>Philip.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I can do all things,</hi> and then inſtantly he leans upon his Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>through Chriſt which ſtrengthneth me.</hi> In God we ſhall be able to do all things, by his grace we ſhall be of power to do all things.</p>
               <p>This muſt be the foundation of our mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, and of our greatnes of mind. And this is that, which the Prophet Eſay ſaith: Iſa. 40.31. They who diſtruſt themſelves, and put their whole confidence in God, ſhal change their ſtrength. For they ſhall change their ſtrength of men, which is meer weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for the ſtrength of God, they ſhall change their arm of fleſh, and blood, for the arm of our Lord: and ſo they ſhall have ſtrength for all things, for they ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do all things in God. And therefore did Saint <hi>Leo</hi> ſay, nothing is hard to the humble, nothing is harſh to the meek. The truly humble man, is he who is magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, couragious, and hardy to enterpriſe,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170072:115"/>and attempt great things: or rather nothing wil be hard to him, becauſe he confides not in himſelf, but in God, and looking up to him, and relying upon him, he contemns al dangers. <hi>In God we can do all things.</hi> This is that, whereof we have much need, a great and couragious mind, and a great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, and not a weak heart which takes away our appetites from doing our duties. So that in our ſelves, we muſt be humble, as knowing that of our ſelves we are nothing, we can do nothing, and we are good for nothing; but in God, and in his power, and grace, we aie to be ſtrong heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the enterpriſing of great things. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> declares this very well, upon thoſe words of the Prophet Eſay; <hi>Here am I, ſend me:</hi> Iſa: 6.8. God was reſolved to ſend one to preach to his People, &amp; for as much as he is pleaſed to work things in us, with our good will and conſent, he ſaid, and ſaid it ſo, as that Eſay might hear him: <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend, and who will go for us?</hi> Iſa: 6.8. To this the Prophet anſwers, <hi>O Lord here I am if you will be pleaſed to ſend me.</hi> Saint <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> pondets very well that he ſaid not, Lord I will go, and can diſpatch this buſines, for he was humble, and knew this own weakneſs well, and ſaw that it was boldnes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for himſelf, that he would perform ſo great a vvork, vvhich overcame his ſtrength but he ſaid, <hi>Lord here I am ready,</hi> and vvilling
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170072:116"/>to receive that which you ſhall be pleaſed to give; do you ſend me, for upon your war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant I will go. As if he had ſaid, for my part I have no ability for ſo high a Miniſtery as that, but you are able to make me ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, you can put words into my mouth, which will have a power to make a change in the hearts of men. If you ſend me, I may well go; for going in your name, I ſhall be able to perform the work. Then God ſaid to him, <hi>Vade, Go,</hi> See here, ſaith Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> how the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> took his degree for being a Preacher, and an Apoſtle of God: becauſe he could anſwer very well in the Doctrine of <hi>Humility,</hi> and attributed not his going to himſelf, but acknovvledg his own inſufficiency, and weaknes, he placed all his confidence in God, beleeving he could do all things in him, and that if God ſent him, he might go. For this reaſon, God gave him the charge, and bad him go, and ſo made him his Preacher, Embaſſador, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. This is to be our ſtrength, and our magnanimity, for the enterpriſing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking great things. Be not therefore diſanimated, or diſmayed, when you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your own inſufficiency, and weakneſs, Jer. 1.7.8. <hi>Say not I am a child</hi> (ſaith God to the Prophet Jeremiah) <hi>for thou ſhalt go to all that I ſhall ſend thee, and whatſoever I command thee, thou ſhalt ſpeak. Be not afraid of their faces, for I am with thee.</hi> So that, for as
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170072:116"/>much as concerns this part of <hi>Humility,</hi> not only it is not contrary to magnanimity, but rather it is the foundation, and root there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point, which belongs to the magnanimous perſon, is to deſire to do great things, and that in themſelves they may be worthy of honour. But this alſo is not contrary to <hi>Humility,</hi> becauſe as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> ſaith very well, although the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous perſon deſire to do ſuch things, yet he deſires it not, for humane honour, nor is this his end. He will take care indeed to deſerve it, but not either to procure, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem it. Nay rather he hath a heart, which ſo truly deſpiſeth both honour, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that he holds nothing to be great but vertue, and for love thereof, he is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do great things, deſpiſing the honour which men can give. For vertue is a thing ſo high, that it cannot be honoured or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarded ſufficiently by men, and deſerves to be honoured &amp; rewarded by Almighty God, &amp; therfore the magnanimous perſon values not al the honours of the World at a ſtraw. It is a mean thing, and of no price at al with him, his flight is higher. For the only love of God; and vertue, is he invited to do great things, and he deſpiſes all the reſt. Now then, for the having of a heart which is ſo great, ſo generous, ſuch a deſpiſer of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and diſhonour of men, ſuch as the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170072:117"/>magnanimous perſon ought to have, it is neceſſary that he have alſo much <hi>Humility.</hi> To the end that a man may arrive to ſo great perfection, as to be able to ſaywith S. <hi>Paul, I know both how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound: every where, and in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full, and to be hungry, both to abound, and to ſuffer need. Phil:</hi> 4.12. <hi>By honour, and diſhonour, by evill report, and good report, as deceivers, and yet true:</hi> 2 Cor: 6.8.9. <hi>As unknown, and yet well known, as dying, and behold we live:</hi> To the end that ſo ſtiffe, and ſo contrary winds, as they of honour, and diſhonour; of praiſe and murmuring, of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and perſecutions, may cauſe no change in us, nor make us ſtumble, or ſhrink, but that we may ſtill remain in our own being, it is neceſſary to have a great foundation of <hi>Humility,</hi> and of wiſdom from Heaven. I know not whether you will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep your ſelf free, for the doing of all good works, when you are in abundance like the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> As for ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring poverty, and to be humble in the midſt of diſhonors, and affronts, this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will be able to do. But to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in honours, chairs, pulpets, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort of Miniſteries, I know not whether you will be able. Alas thoſe Angels once of Heaven, knew not how to do this; but they grew proud, and fell. <hi>Boetius</hi> ſaith. Though both eſtates are to be feared, yet proſperity
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170072:117"/>more then adverſity. It is harder for a man to conſerve himſelf in <hi>Humility,</hi> in honour, and eſtimation of the World, and in high imployments, and Miniſteries, then in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, and contempt, and in the diſcharge of places, which are mean and poor, for theſe things draw <hi>humility</hi> after them, and thoſe others vanity, and pride. <hi>Scientia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flat:</hi> knowledg, and all other high things, do naturally puff us up, and make us giddy, and therefore the Saints ſay, that it is the <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of great and perfect men, to know how to be humble, and amongſt the great gifts and graces which they receive from God, and amongſt the honours and eſtimations of the World.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore procure to arrive to this <hi>humility,</hi> by the grace of our Lord, we I ſay, who are called, not to the end that we ſhould be ſhut up in corners, or be hidden under a buſhel, but ſet up on high, like a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon a hil, or like a taper upon a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, to ſhine, and give light to the World. For which purpoſe it will be neceſſary for us to lay a very good foundation; and for as much as is on our part, to have great deſire to be diſ-eſteemed, and deſpiſed; and that this may flow out of a profound knowledg of our own miſery, our baſenes, and our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIII.</hi> Of the great benefits, and advantages which are in this third degree of Humility.</head>
               <p>AFter King <hi>David</hi> had prepared much gold, and ſilver, and many rich materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for the building of the Temple, he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them up to God, and ſaid theſe words. <hi>All things O Lord are thine, and that which we have received at thy hands, that do we render, &amp; return again.</hi> This is that, which we muſt do and ſay, in all our good works. O <hi>Lord</hi> all our good works are thine, and ſo we return what thou haſt given us. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith very well. He who puts himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the duties, and the ſervices which he hath done thee, of what other thing doth he tell thee O Lord, but of the benefits, and gifts which he hath received from thy holy hand. This is an effect of thy infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and goodnes towards us, to qualifie thine own benefits, and gifts to us, to be as new vertues of ours: and ſo when thou payeſt us for our ſervices, thou rewardeſt thine own benefits, and for one grace of thine, thou giveſt us another, and for one favour another, <hi>Gratiam pro gratia;</hi> Our Lord is content to proceed with us, like another <hi>Joſeph,</hi> by giving us not only corn, but he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170072:118"/>will alſo give us the price, and mony which it coſt. All is Gods gift, and all muſt be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, and returned to him, he giveth both grace, and glory.</p>
               <p>One of the great helps and benefits, which is to be reaped, by this third degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> is that it is the good, and true gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and thankſgiving, for the benefits which we have received at the hand of God. It is well known how highly the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thanks, and gratitude is recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and eſteemed in holy Scripture; ſince we ſee that when our Lord vouchſafed any remarkable benefit to his people, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ordained, that ſome memory, or ſeaſt of thankſgiving ſhould be inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: becauſe gratitude doth much import us, towards the receiving of new graces and favours. Now this is very well effected, by this third degree of <hi>humility,</hi> which conſiſts as hath been ſaid, in that a man attribute nothing to himſelf, but all to God, and to give him the glory of all. For in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts true gratitude, and giving of thanks; and not in ſaying with the tongue, O Lord I give thee thanks for thy benefits, though yet we muſt alſo praiſe, and give God thanks, with the tongue. But if you ſhall do it with the tongue alone, it will not be to give thanks, but to ſay thanks. But now to the end that it may not be only be ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thanks, and not only with the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170072:119"/>mouth, but with the heart, and indeed it will be neceſſary for us to acknowledg, that all the good we have is of God, and that we muſt aſcribe, and return it all to him, giving him thanks for it all, and retaining to our ſelves no part thereof: for in this ſort, a man ſtrips himſelf of that honour which he ſees to be none of his own, and he gives it to God, whoſe it is. And this did <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> intend to make us know, in the holy Goſpel, when having cured thoſe Leapers, and one only returning to give him thanks for the benefit which they had al received, he ſaid thus: <hi>There is none who hath returned, and given glory to God, but this ſtranger.</hi> And when God admoniſhed the people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el that they muſt be grateful, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the benefits which they had received, he gave them this advertiſement; <hi>Deut:</hi> 8-11. <hi>Take heed that you for get not God, when you ſhall be in the Land of promiſe, in great proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of temporal goods, of houſes, Lands, and ſtock, take heed that your hearts be not then puffed up, and that you become not ungratefull, and ſay that you have obtained it by your own wiſdom, and ſtrength. My power, and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth v:</hi> 17. This is to forget God, and this is the greateſt ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude into which a man can fall, to aſcribe the gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of God to himſelf. Take heed you have not once a thought of any ſuch thing as this. But ſee that you remember God,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170072:119"/>and acknowledg that the ſtrength was his, and that he fortified you in all things: and this, not for any deſert of yours, but only to comply with the promiſe, which of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he had franckly made, to your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. This is the gratitude, and rendring of praiſe: wherewith our Lord God will be honoured, for the benefits and favours which he imparts to us. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 50.23. <hi>Who ſo offereth me thanks and praiſe, he honoureth me.</hi> This is the ſum of Saint <hi>Pauls Doxology. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, and inviſible, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe God, be honour and glory, for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Amen.</hi> That God onely have the glory of all.</p>
               <p>From hence alſo grows another benefit, and good, that the true humble man, though he have many gifts of God, and be much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed and valued by the whole World for them, doth not yet eſteem and value himſelf, one hair the more, for that: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſo firm in the knowledg of his own baſenes, as if none of that which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, were to be found in him. For he knows very well, how to diſtinguiſh that which is his own, from that which belongs to another: and to aſſign to every one his own: and ſo he beholds the benefits and graces which he hath received from God, not as his own, but as anothers; by whom they were lent, and he alſo lodges his eyes upon his own baſenes, and miſery, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170072:120"/>on that which he would not fail to be, if God ſhould take off his hand, even for one minute, and were not ever conſerving, and holding him up. Yea and even whilſt he is receiving the gifts of God, he is the more humbled, and confounded thereby. Saint <hi>Dorotheus</hi> ſaith, that as it happens with trees, which are mighty loaden with fruit, the ſame very fruit makes the bows ſtoop, and abaſe themſelves; and that, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo fat, as to break them with their great wait, whereas the boughs which bear no fruit remain perking up, and high; and as ears of Corn, when they are very ful, hang down their heads, ſo far that they ſeem, as if they would even break the ſtalk, whereon they grow: and when they ſtand boult upright, it is a ſhrewd ſign that they have nothing in them; ſo it hapneth ſaith he in the way of ſpirit, that they who are emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and without fruit, look bigg, and lofty, and hold themſelves for gallant men; but they on the other ſide, who are much loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with fruit, and are ful of the graces and gifts of God, are the more humble, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded thereby. For even from thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and gifts, the true ſervants of God take occaſion to be the more humbled, &amp; to walk with the more warines, and fear. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, that as a man who hath bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed great ſums of mony, is glad in ſuch ſort, that he hath borrowed it, as that yet
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170072:120"/>this joy of having received it, is very ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently watered, by the knowing that he is in obligation to pay it again; &amp; care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether he ſhall be able to comply, when his Bond is due; ſo the man who is truly humble, the more gifts he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he acknowledges himſelf to be ſo much the more deeply a Debtor, to Almighty God, and ſo much the more bound to ſerve him, and he is ſtill thinking, that he correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds not to theſe greater favours, by grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervices, nor to greater graces, by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thanks; and he conceives and beleeves, that to whomſoever God would have ſhewed that goodneſs, which he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, that man would have made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe of it, and would have been more grateful, and a better man. And ſo, one of the conſiderations which makes the true ſervants of God to be very much humbled and confounded is this; They know that God will not only call them to an account for their ſins committed, but for his favour alſo received and they know that to whom God gives much, from him he will require much, and to whom he gives more, of him he wil alſo require more Holy <hi>Macarius</hi> ſaith, that the humble man looks upon the gifts and favours of God, as ſome depoſitary or treaſurer would do, who had his maſters goods in his hands; for ſuch a one will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be in fear and care, than in pride, leſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170072:121"/>ſomwhat ſhould, by his fault be loſt, when they call him to make up his accounts.</p>
               <p>From hence alſo grows yet another good, which is, that the man who is truly humble, diſeſteems or deſpiſes no other man, into whatſoever defects and ſins he may perhaps ſee him fall, nor wil he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by grow proud, or eſteem himſelf the more, for that; but rather wil take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby, to humble himſelf the more by having ſeen him fal, through the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the other, and himſelf, and both made of the ſame mould, and that when the other fals, he alſo fals, for as much as he is in himſelf. For, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, there is no ſin which is committed by any one, which another man would not, or might not commit, if the hand of Gods mercy with-held him not. And ſo one of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient Fathers, when he heard that any man had fallen, was wont to weep bitterly, and ſay: To day for him, and to morrow for me. As he fel, I might as wel have fallen, ſince I am a weak man as he is. I muſt eſteem it, as a moſt particular bleſſing of our Lord, that I fel not too. Thus do all the Saints adviſe us, that whenſoever we ſee one man blind, another deaf, another lame, another maimed, or ſick: we muſt eſteem all thoſe miſeries of theirs, to be benefits of ours, and give thanks to God, for not having made us blind, or deaf, or lame, or maimed, as he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170072:121"/>made him. And ſo alſo muſt we make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the fins of al other men, are ſo many benefits of our own, for I might have committed them al, if our Lord out of his infinite mercy, had not defended me. By this means, the ſervants of God preſerve themſelves in <hi>Humility,</hi> and in not deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their neighbors, and in not carrying themſelves high againſt others: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever faults or ſins they diſcern in them, according to that of St. <hi>Gregory;</hi> True ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice makes us have compaſſion of our neighbors, and falſe juſtice diſdain and ſcorn. But ſuch men as theſe, have reaſon to be afraid of that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> Lpray God they com not to be tempted, in that very thing which they condemn in others: and that, at length, they find not to their coſt, how great that miſery is, which uſes to be the puniſhment of this ſin. In three things, ſaid one of thoſe ancient. Fathers, have I judged others, and my ſelf fel into them al: To the end that we may know, by experience, that our ſelves alſo are but men, and that we may learn, neither to judge nor deſpiſe any man.</p>

But yet, we may wel apply them to <hi>Humility,</hi> and ſay that al good things com to us thereby; ſince the ſame Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaith, that <hi>where Humility is, there alſo is wiſdom. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi eſt Humilitas, ibi &amp; Sapientia.</hi> And in another place, he ſaith, that to have this <hi>Humility,</hi> is ſupreme wiſdom. And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God gives wiſdom to the humble.</hi> But beſides this, we are taught this truth, in expreſſe terms both in the old and new Teſtament; where great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and graces are promiſed to them, by Almighty God; ſomtimes by the name of the humble: at other times, of little ones, and ſomtimes of the poor of ſpirit, for by theſe, and ſuch other names are they, who are truly humble, called.

And that alſo which Chriſt our Lord ſaid in the holy Goſpel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Whoſoever exalteth himſelf, ſhal be abaſed: and be that humbleth himſelf, ſhal be exalted.</hi> As the waters run down the vallies, ſo the rains of Gods grace, fal down upon the humble. And as vallies uſe to abound with fruit, by reaſon of the much water which is aſſembled there: ſo they, who are lowe and humble in his ſight, uſe to yeeld much fruit, through the many gifts, and graces, which they receive from God. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Humility</hi> draws down the moſt high God to it ſelf. God is high, and if you humble your ſelves, he wil deſcend to you; but if you grow proud, and exalt your ſelves, he wil ſly from you. Wil you know why, ſaith St <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Becauſe (as we are taught by the loyal Prophet) <hi>God is a high and ſeteraign Lord, and he looks
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170072:123"/>upon ſuch as are humble:</hi> and his looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, is to fil them with al good things: but he ſaith, that <hi>God ſees the ptoud from far off,</hi> becauſe, as when heer, we ſee a man far off, we know him not, ſo doth God not know the proud, in order to ſhew them any favour. I tel you for a certain truth, ſaith God, to wicked and proud people, that <hi>I know you not,</hi> Luk. 13.27. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſaith, as when wax is ſoft, it is ready to receive any impreſſion, which men wil make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: ſo doth Humility diſpoſe your ſouls to receive virtue and grace from God. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> invited his brethren, the youngeſt of them al, had the beſt part.</p>
               <p>But let us now look after the cauſe, why God raiſes the humble ſo high, and is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do them ſo great favour. It is, becauſe al his goods do thus com back again to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For the humble man carries nothing away, and attributes nothing to himſelf: but intirely aſcribes and reſtores al to God, and gives him the honour, and glory of al. Such as theſe, ſaith God, may very wel be truſted with our goods : we may wel put our riches and bleſſings into their hands, for they are ſafe perſons, and wil not riſe and run away with them: and ſo God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with them, as in a caſe meerly his own; becauſe al the honour and glory is ſtil his Even heer we ſee, that a great lord or King, holds it for a point of greatneſs, to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170072:123"/>raiſe a man ſomtimes, out of the very duſt of the earth (as we uſe to ſay) who before was nothing, and who had nothing; for ſo is the bounty and greatneſs of that King, the more viſibly perceived. Thus ſaith the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor: 4.7. <hi>We have the treaſure of the graces, and gifts of God, in pots of clay, to the end that the world may know, that the treaſure is Gods and not ours:</hi> for clay breeds no ſuch commodity as that. So that for this, doth God exalt the humble, and ſhew them ſo many favours: and for this doth he leave proud men empty: becauſe the proud man confides much in himſelf, and in his own diligences and ways, and aſcribes much to himſelf, and takes a vain contentment in the good ſucceſs of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, as if it had been diſpatched by his own induſtries and pains, and al this, takes ſomwhat from God, and ſteals away that honour and glory, which is proper to his divine Majeſtie. As ſoon as we have once made ſom little entrance in to the uſe of prayer with any little devotion, any little tear, which we ſhed, we conceive that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie we are grown to be ſpiritual, &amp; men of prayer. And ſomtimes we wil be alſo preferring our ſelves, before others, and we wil think that they have not profited ſo much, nor are grown ſo ſpiritual as we. For this reaſon, our Lord doth us no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſavour; and ſomtimes he takes that from
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170072:124"/>us which he had given us; left the good ſhould to us, be an occaſion of il, and left health ſhould be turned into ſickneſs, and treacle into poyſon and ſo his benefits and gifts, ſhould prove to our damnation through our il uſe thereof: as to the ſick man of a weak ſtomack, though the meat be good, yet they muſt give him but little of it, becauſe he hath not ſtrength to digeſt more; and if they gave him more, it would corrupt, and be converted into il humour. That oyl of the Prophet <hi>Elizeus,</hi> never gave over to run, til ſuch time as veſſels were wanting, wherein it might be received: but then the holy Scripture ſaith, inſtantly the oyl forbore to run. Now ſuch is the oyl of the mercy of God, which, in it ſelf, is not limited: for the graces and mercies of God, have no limits at al, on his part. God hath not ſtreightned, or cloſed his hand, nor is his nature changed; for God is neither chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor can change, but ever remains in his own nature, and hath more deſire to give, then we to take. The fault is on our ſide, who want empty veſſels to receive the oyl of the graces and mercies of God. We are very ſul of our ſelves, and put much truſt in our own endevour. Humility, and the knowledge of our own weakneſs emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the houſe, and takes a man off from himſelf, and makes him diſtruſt himſelf, and all humane helps, and aſcribes nothing to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170072:124"/>himſelf, but al to God; and to ſuch men as theſe, God ſhews his favours with ful hands.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXXV.</hi> How much it imports us to betake our ſelves to Humility, to ſupply thereby, what ſiever is wanting to us in virtue, and perfections, and to the end that God may not humble us, by puniſhing us.</head>
               <p>THe bleſſed St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, A very ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid fool is he, who confides in any thing but Humility: for alas, we have al ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and offended God, many ways: and ſo we can plead right to nothing, but puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>If man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, wil contend with God, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand.</hi> Job 9. 3. To a thouſand accuſations he wil not be able to give one good diſcharge. What then remains, ſaith he, and to what other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſhal we have recourſe, but only to retire our ſelves towards Humility: and to ſupply by that, the want, which we may have of other things. And becauſe this is a remedy of much importance, the Saint repeats it many times, both in theſe, and other words: Let that which is wanting to you in the purity of your conſcience be ſupplied by
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170072:125"/>your being aſhamed of your ſelves: and let that which is wanting to you in fervour, and perfection, be made up by your confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And St. <hi>Dorotheus</hi> recommended his very much; and ſaid, Brethren, ſince we cannot, through our weakneſs, work, and labour ſo much as we would: yet let us humble our ſelves at leaſt, &amp; by this means I hope that we ſhal hereafter be able to find our ſelves, in ſociety with them who have wrought hard. And when, after you have committed many ſins, you ſhal find your ſelves diſabled to do many works of repentance and mortification, for want of health; walk you quietly on, by the plain and even way of <hi>Humility,</hi> for ſo you wil meet with a moſt convenient means for your ſalvation. If you think you be not able to enter into and excel in prayer; enter at leaſt into your own confuſion: if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that you have no talent for impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant things, procure to get Humility, for by this, you ſhal ſupply for al thoſe things.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore conſider heer, how little our Lord asks of us, and with how little he contents himſelf. He deſires, that according to our baſeneſs, we would know, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves. If God ſhould ask of us great Faſts, great and many good works, great and high contemplation; ſom men might excuſe themſelves, and ſay, that they had no ſtrength for the one, and no talent or
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170072:125"/>ability for the other. But for the not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our ſelves we have no reaſon or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to alledge. You cannot ſay, that you have not health to be humble, or that you have no talent or ability for that. There is nothing more caſie, (ſaith Sain <hi>Bernard</hi>) than for a man to humble himſelf, if he have a mind to it. We can al do this, if we wil, and we have matter enough for it, to work upon, within doors. Al the furniture of thy <hi>Humility</hi> thou haſt at home. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore retire out ſelves now at laſt, to Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſo let us ſupply with conſuſion, that which is wanting to us of perfection, and ſo we ſhal be able to move the bowels of God, to mercy and pardon. At leaſt, ſince we are poor let us be humble too; and we ſhal give contentment to God; but to be poor and proud, wil offend him much. Of three things, which the Wiſeman ſets down, to be much abhorred by Almighty God, this is the firſt. A poor man that is proud: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 25.2. Yea and even it is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, alſo amongſt men.</p>
               <p>But let us humble our ſelves at leaſt, leſt God humble us, for thus he is very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily wont to do. <hi>He that exalteth himſelf ſhal be humbled.</hi> Luk. 14 10. If therefore you wil not have god humble you, take care to humble your ſelves. This is a very principal point, and worthy to be conſidered, and pondered at great leiſure. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170072:126"/>Do you know how much God loves <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and how greatly he abhors pride and preſumption? He abhors it ſo much, that he permits us firſt to fal into certain ſins, and many little faults: to the end that he may teach us, that ſince we are not able to keep our ſelves from little ſins, and temptations, but that we ſtil find our ſelves to ſtumble, and daily to fal in mean things, and very eaſie to be withſtood we may be very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that in our ſelves we have no means to avoid ſuch as are greater: and that ſo we may not be proud, when there is queſtion of great things, nor attribute any thing to our ſelves, but vvalk ever on vvith <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and fear, and beſeech our <hi>Lord</hi> to ſhevv us ſavour and grace St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> upon thoſe vvords, <hi>And without him was not any thing made that was made:</hi> Joh. 1.3. And St. <hi>Jerom</hi> upon that of the Prophet <hi>Joel: And I wil reſtore to you the yeers that the loruſt hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm:</hi> Joel 2.25 Say that to humble a man, and to tame his pride, God created theſe little animals, and poor baſe vvorms vvhich are ſo troubleſom to us and that the proud people of <hi>Pharach,</hi> might eaſily have been tamed and humbled, if God vvould have ſent Bears, Lyons, and Serpents, in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; but he thought fit to tame their pride, by the baleſt ſort of creatures, as gnats, flyes, and frogs, that he might humble
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170072:126"/>them ſo much the more. And ſo alſo, to the end that we may be humbled, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, God permits us to fal into little faults; and gives vvay that ſom poor and vveak temptations, vvhich are like gnats, and eem not indeed to have any body, or bulk in them; may ſomtimes make vvar againſt us. If vve vvil pauſe to conſider at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, vvhat is vvont ſomtimes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and put us from our eaſe: vve ſhal find that they are certain trifling things, vvhich being ſiſted, and diſcovered vvel, have no ſubſtance in them at al. I knovv not vvhat little vvord they ſaid to me; or els they ſaid it to me in ſuch a manner; or me thought they made light of me; and the like. Of a fly vvhich paſſes through the air, a man ſomtimes vvil build a vvhole tovver of vvind, and then adding one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it ſhal ſerve to make his heart very unquiet. What vvould then becom of us, if God ſhould let looſe ſom Lyon, or Tyger againſt us, vvhen vve are put into ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, by a gnat? What would becom of us, if we vvere ſet upon, by ſom grievous temptation? And thus are vve to dravv more Humility and confuſion, out of ſuch things as theſe. And if as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, this be dravvn from thene, it is a great mercy and benefit and favour of God, that ſuch toys as thoſe, may not be wanting to us, and that this may be able to make us humble.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:170072:127"/>
               <p>But if theſe ſlight things wil not ſerve the turn, then know, that God vvil paſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on, and that very much to your coſt, for ſo he is accuſtomed to do. God doth ſo highly abhor preſumption, and pride, and loves Humility, ſo much, that the Saints af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that he is vvont, through his juſt and moſt ſocret judgment, to permit that a man may ſal into grievous ſins, to the end that he may be humbled thereby, yea and even into carnal ſins which are the moſt ugly, and ful of ſhame, to the end that they may be humbled the more. They ſay that he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes ſecret pride with open luſt. And to this purpoſe they bring that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of thoſe Philoſophers, vvhom for their pride, <hi>God delivered over to the deſires of their hearts.</hi> Rom. 1.24. They came to fal into unclean ſins, which were moſt filthy, and not to be named, God permitting it ſo for their pride, to the end that they might be humbled, and confounded, when they ſaw themſelves turned beaſts, with the heart, and converſation, and cuſtom of beaſts. <hi>Who would not ſear thee, O King of Nations?</hi> Jer. 10.7. Who wil not tremble at this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is ſo great as that there is none greater out of hel? Nay ſin is even worſe than hel. <hi>Who O Lord hath known the power of thy wrath? or who is able to relate it</hi> (ſo the vulgar Latin readeth) <hi>through the great ſear which ought to be had thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:170072:127"/>
               <p>The Saints note, that God in theſe caſes is wont to uſe two kinds of mercy towards us, a greater mercy and a leſs The leſs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is, vvhen he ſuccours us in our leſs miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are the temporal, and ſuch as only concern the body; and the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is when he ſuccours us in our great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, which are the ſpiritual, and which concern the ſoul. And ſo when <hi>David</hi> ſaw himſelf in his great miſery, of being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and diſpoſſeſſed of God, by the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and murther which he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he cried out, and beggs the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God: <hi>Have mercy upon me O God, after thy great goodneſs:</hi> Pſal: 51.1. They ſay alſo that there is a great, and a little anger of God. The leſſer is, when he puniſhes men here, in the temporal, with adverſities, in loſs of goods, of honour, health, and the like, which only concern the body; but the great anger is, when the puniſhment goes ſo far, that it arrives to the interior part of the ſoul, according to that of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, The ſword reacheth unto the ſoul:</hi> Jer. 4.10. And this is that which God ſaith by the Prophet <hi>Zachary, I wil be angry, with my great anger, with that Nation which is proud and puffed up.</hi> Zach. 1.15. When God forſakes a man, and permits him to fal into hainous ſins in puniſhment of his other ſins, this is the great anger of God; theſe are wounds which are given by divine indignation, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170072:128"/>they are not as of a Father, but as of a juſt and righteous Judge. Of which vvounds, that of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: <hi>I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with a cruel puniſhment.</hi> Jer. 30.14. And ſo alſo ſaith the Wiſeman: <hi>The mouth of ſtrange women is a deep pit: he that is abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Lord ſhal fal therein.</hi> Finally, pride is ſo wicked a thing, and ſo much abhorred by Almighty God, that the Saints ſay, that ſomtimes it is good for the proud man, to be thus puniſhed by Almighty God, that ſo he may com to be cured of his pride. So ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> I preſume to ſay, that it is profitable and good, for proud men, that God permit them to ſal into ſom viſible and external ſin, that ſo they vvho were very vvel ſatisfied and pleaſed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and vvere already ſalu, though they perceived it not; may ſo begin to knovv, and to humble, and diſtruſt themſelves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Wiſeman: <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Pride goeth before deſtruction: and an haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpirit before a fal.</hi> The ſame do St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> affirm. St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> by the occaſion of the ſin of <hi>David,</hi> asks vvhy God permits that the elect, and ſuch as he hath predeſtinated to eternal life, and on vvhom he had heaped up his graces, and gifts, ſhould fal ſometimes into carnal and filthy ſins; and he anſvvers, that the reaſon of it is, becauſe ſomtimes, thy vvho have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170072:128"/>great graces fal into pride, and they have it ſo rooted, and even wrought into the moſt intimous part of the heart; that they themſelves underſtand it not; but are ſo wel pleaſed, and confident of themſelves, as to think that God and they, are al one. As it happened to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Apoſtle, who conceived not, that thoſe words of his, had flowed from pride, when he ſaid, Though al men ſhal be offended becauſe of thee, yet wil I never be offended: <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.33. but he thought that it had been cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in him, and an extraordinary love which he carried to his Maſter. Therefore to cure ſuch pride as this, which lyes ſo cloſe and is ſo diſguiſed, as that a man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready faln, though himſelf perceive it not, our <hi>Lord</hi> permits ſomtimes, that ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons fal into certain manifeſt, exterior car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal filthy ſins; to the end that ſo they may know themſelves better, and look more exactly into their ſouls: and may ſo com to perceive their pride, which they beleeved not to be in them before: and whereof they look for no remedy, and would ſo have com to periſh; but now by means of ſuch groſs fals, they know it, and being humbled now in the ſight of God, they repent both for the one and the other, and ſo meet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for both their miſeries at once, as we ſee St. <hi>Peter</hi> did: who by that viſible and apparent fal of his, came to know that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170072:129"/>pride which lay ſo ſecretly within, and he grew to lament it, and to repent for them both: and thus was his fal good for him. The ſame hapned alſo to <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.71. who therefore ſaith, <hi>O Lord it hath coſt me dear, I confeſs it, but yet, upon the whole matter, it hath been good for me that I have been humbled,</hi> that ſo hereafter I may learn to ſerve thee, and know how to abaſe my ſelf as I ought. And as the wiſe Phyſitian, when he is not able to cure the malady out right, and when the peccant humor is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and maligne, that he cannot make nature digeſt, and overcom it; procures to cal and draw it into the exterior parts of the body, that ſo it may be the better cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: juſt ſo, for the cure of certain haughty and rebellious ſouls, doth our <hi>Lord</hi> permit them to fal into grievous and exterior ſins, to the end that they may know, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves: and by means of that abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which appears without, the maligne and peſtilent humor may be alſo cured, which lay cloſe within. And this is a work vvhich God vvorks in Iſrael, vvhich vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever coms to hear, his very ears ſhal even tingle for meer fear: theſe I ſay, are thoſe great puniſhments of God, the onely hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vvhereof, is able to make men tremble, from head to foot.</p>
               <p>But yet our <hi>Lord</hi> vvho is ſo ful of benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and mercy, doth never imploy this fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigorous
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170072:129"/>puniſhment, nor this ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and unhappy remedy, but after having uſed other means, which were moſt gentle and ſweet. He firſt ſends us other occaſions, and other more gentle induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſo we may humble our ſelves. Sometimes ſickneſſe, ſometimes a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſometimes a murmuration, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a diſhonour, when a man is brought lower then he thought. But when theſe temporall things will not ſerve the turn to humble us, he paſſes on to the ſpirituall: and firſt, to things of leſſe moment, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by permitting fierce and grievous temptations, ſuch as may bring us ſo within a hairs breadth, and even perſwade us, or at leaſt make us doubt whether we conſented or no. That ſo a man may ſee and find by good experience, that he cannot overcome them by himſelf, but may experimentally underſtand his own miſery, and the preciſe need which he hath of help from heaven: and ſo may come to diſtruſt his own ſtrength, and may humble himſelf. And when all this will not ſerve, then comes that other ſo violent and ſo coſtly cure, of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a man to fall into hainous ſin, and to be ſubdued by the temptation. Then comes this Cautery, which is made even by the very fire of hell; to the end that after a man hath even as it were beaten out his
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170072:130"/>brains, he may fall at length upon the juſt examination and knowledge of what he is, and may at length be content to humble himſelf by this means, ſince he would not be brought to do it by any other. By this time I hope we ſee well how mightily it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports us to be humble, and not to confide or preſume upon our ſelves: and therefore let every one enter into account with his own heart, and conſider what profit he reaps by thoſe occaſions which God dayly ſends for the making him humble, in the quality of a tender-hearted Phyſician, and of a father, that ſo there may be no need of thoſe other which are ſo violent. <hi>Chastiſe me, O Lord, with the chastiſement of a Father:</hi> cure thou my pride with afflictions, diſeaſes, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and affronts, and with as many humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations as thou art pleaſed to ſend: but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not, O Lord, that I ſhould ever fall into deliberate and wilful ſin. O Lord, let the Devil have power to touch me in point of honour, and in my health, and let him make another <hi>Job</hi> of me: but permit not that he may ever touch my ſoul. Upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thou, O Lord, never part from me, nor permit me ever to part from thee, whatſoever tribulation may com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>UNderſtanding, O my bleſſed Lord, how diſpleaſing pride is unto thee, and how thou hateſt ſelf-conceit, if I had indeed any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as I ought, the conſideration thereof would ſufficiently perſwade me, that I ſhould not onely diſlike but abhorre it, as a mortal and damnable thing, ſince thou, O Lord, doſt ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it, that the Angels whom thou cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atedſt with ſo many perfections, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornedſt with ſuch be auties &amp; gifts, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the poſſeſſion of thy inwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt heaven, yet for this ſin onely didſt thou baniſh them thence into the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pit, where they ſuffer the condigne puniſhment of their hainous offence. and from that time till this preſent, and from this time for ever to come, the proud thou alwayes haſt and ever wilt abhorre: and they are they on whom it ſeems thou delighteſt to ſhew the power of thy mighty Arm; humbling them, caſting them down, and making them equal with the earth, that they may underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not dare to lift up their heads againſt thee.

It is abominable to thee in them who have it through opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own excellent beauty, ſo as had <hi>Abſalom,</hi> whom thou ſufferedſt to be hanged up by the hair, of which he went ſo proud. It is deteſtable to thee in them who lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by reaſon of their great Riches and Dominions, as did <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> whom therefore thou draveſt out to live &amp; feed among bruit Beaſts. It is odious to thee in them who are opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated of their own wiſdome, as was manifeſted in <hi>Achitophel,</hi> whom thou ſufferedſt to become his own executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. by a ſhamefull death becauſe his counſell was not followed. Thou hateſt it in words, thou hateſt it in Vertue and Goodneſſe it ſelf, knowing it to be the moth and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker thereof, as thou taughteſt us in the preſumptuous Phariſee, ſending him
<pb facs="tcp:170072:132"/>away deſpiſed and rejected, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he vaunted before thee his own worth, and ſet forth his own Praiſes. And therefore did thy ſervant <hi>Tobit</hi> counſel, Let not Pride entet at any time into thy underſtanding, nor into any thing thou thinkeſt, ſayeſt, or doeſt. To conſider this, O Lord, by ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples evinced, that Pride is ſo much abominable to thee, and ſo ſurely and ſharply puniſhed in them in whom thou findeſt it, were more then ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if I had not leſſe then no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to breed an abhorring of it in my heart, and an utter reſtraint thereof, not onely in deeds and words, but the inwardeſt thoughts of my heart. For though I were Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, yet ſhould I not be like <hi>Goliah:</hi> if I had Command, yet it would be much leſs then <hi>Holophernes:</hi> though a Favourite, yet could I not match <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> and alſo if I might paſſe others, yet how far muſt I fall ſhort of <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> in Beauty; in Majeſty and Power of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> in Wiſdome of <hi>Achitophel;</hi> in Holineſs and all other Excellency of the Angels before their fall? and yet all theſe in their ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:170072:133"/>kinds, wherein their hearts were lifte up, were by thee brought down to the loweſt of ſhame and confuſion, and to the height of miſery and calamity, to the proportion of their Pride and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But if to this I ſhall add the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of mine own frame, and the condition of the things themſelves for which I am lifted up in mine own conceit, either I muſt leave all Pride, or elſe clean quit all claim to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of a man. For my being is but earth, and a clod thereof, ſo frail, ſo poor and beggarly, that I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloath my ſelf without ſtripping others, nor maintain mine own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking the lives from Birds, Beaſts, or Fiſhes. Nor can I breath without air, nor ſee without light, nor hear without ſound, nor live at all without the help of thy meaneſt creatures. And beſides all this, ſo encompaſſed with neceſſity, ſo environed with wants, of hunger, of thirſt, of ſleep, ſo tired with labour, ſo beſet with dangers, ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with miſeries, as if I rightly take the eſtimate of my ſelf, I muſt adjudge my ſelf of all thy other works the moſt wretched and contemptible.
<pb facs="tcp:170072:133"/>And what alas, if I truly weigh them, are thoſe things which make me ſwel, but lighter, and leſs worth then vanity it ſelf? Every injury of weather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers my health, the lighteſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs abates my ſtrength, the leaſt pains overthrow my contents, but a few hours want of ſuſtenance enfeebles me, a few dayes kils me. Riches ſlip away like water from between my fingers, and if not rightly uſed, they a here to ſorrows, and increaſe torments here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Hel. Honour vaniſheth like ſmoak, Nobility is baſeneſs, except it be ſet in virtue, Applauſe of the world paſſeth like a dream in them that give and take it. Favour of Princes laſteth no longer then themſelves, and they periſh when they leaſt think it. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is flattery and private Intereſt. Love is unſound in ſubſtance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and fickle in durance. Wiſdome is folly, and Learning is wearineſs. And if the account be right caſt, our Knowledge amounts to no more then what we do. So that on all hands, if I rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, there is no ground but for <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> no colour but for Lowlineſs; and in their ſeveral kinds all things cry out
<pb facs="tcp:170072:134"/>that I have in me infinite matter of confuſion and ſhame, nothing at all to glory or priſe my ſelf for, onely my folly, which, as I am, is more then all the reſt in me, the cauſe to puff me up. That it is, and onely that, that makes me lofty, preſumptuous, ſelf-conceited, vain. Lord, heal me of this frenzy, and reſtore me again to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that with that Humility of ſpirit which I ought, I may henceforth ſerve thee, eſteeming my ſelf of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the leaſt, towards thee nothing. <hi>Amen.</hi>
